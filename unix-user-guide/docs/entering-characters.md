<h1 class="heading"><span class="name"> Entering Characters</span></h1>

It is necessary to select a metakey which is to be used to enter characters. In this document this metakey is represented by the string "APL". In a terminal window under a Linux GUI Dyalog recommends using the Windows key as the metakey to generate APL characters; with PuTTY and the Unicode IME the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key is used (similarly to the Windows Unicode edition of Dyalog APL). For example, in a terminal window <kbd>WindowsKey</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>generates an `⍺`; when using PuTTY the same APL character is entered by using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>. 

!!!note 
    Under PuTTY, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>xcv</kbd> are reserved for the operating system; we shall see later that <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> is used for another purpose. Rather than  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>xcv</kbd> you must use  <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>xcv</kbd>.

Linux Window managers are in generally in a state of flux, so it is best to look at the following article on the Dyalog Forum for the latest information about keyboard configuration:
