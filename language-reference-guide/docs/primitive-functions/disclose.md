The symbol chosen to represent Disclose depends on the current Migration Level.


If  `⎕ML<2`, Disclose is represented by the symbol: `⊃`.


If  `⎕ML≥2`, Disclose is represented by the symbol: `↑`.


`Y` may be any array.  `R` is an array.  If `Y` is non-empty, `R` is the value of the first item of `Y` taken in ravel order.  If `Y` is empty, `R` is the prototype of `Y`.


Disclose is the inverse of Enclose.  The identity `R←→⊃⊂R` holds for all `R`.  Disclose is also referred to as First.
