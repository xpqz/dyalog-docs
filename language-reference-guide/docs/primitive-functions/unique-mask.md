`Y` may be any array.


`R` is a Boolean vector whose length is the number of major cells
in `Y`. For each major cell of `Y`, the corresponding element of  `R` is 1 if it is the first occurrence of that value, and 0 if it is a duplicate of an earlier major cell.


`⎕CT` and `⎕DCT` are  implicit arguments of Unique.
