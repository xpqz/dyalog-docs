`Y` must be a numeric array.  `X` must be a numeric array.  `R` is numeric.  The value of `R` is `X` raised to the power of `Y`.


If `Y` is zero, `R` is defined to be 1.


If `X` is zero, `Y` must be non-negative.


In general, `X*Y` is defined as `*Y×⍟X`. If `X` is negative, the result `R` is likely to be complex.
