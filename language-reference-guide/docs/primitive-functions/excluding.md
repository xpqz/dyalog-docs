`X` must be a scalar or vector.  `R` is a vector of the elements of `X` excluding those elements which occur in `Y` taken in the order in which they occur in `X`.


Elements of `X` and `Y` are considered the same if `X≡Y` returns 1 for those elements.


`⎕CT` and `⎕DCT` are  implicit arguments of Excluding. Excluding is also known as Without.
