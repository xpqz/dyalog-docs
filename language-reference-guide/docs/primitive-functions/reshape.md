`Y` may be any array.  `X` must be a simple scalar or vector of non-negative integers.  `R` is an array of shape `X` whose elements are taken from `Y` in row-major sequence and repeated cyclically if required.  If `Y` is empty, `R` is composed of fill elements of `Y` (`⊂∊⊃Y` with `⎕ml←0`).  If `X` contains at least one zero, then `R` is empty.  If `X` is an empty vector, then `R` is scalar.
