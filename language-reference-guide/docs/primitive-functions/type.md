Migration level must be such that `⎕ML<1` (otherwise `∊` means Enlist. See [Enlist](enlist.md)).


`Y` may be any array.  `R` is an array with the same shape and structure as `Y` in which a numeric value is replaced by 0 and a character value is replaced by `' '`.



**Examples**

```apl
      ∊(2 3⍴⍳6)(1 4⍴'TEXT')
 0 0 0
 0 0 0
 
      ' '=∊'X'
1
```
