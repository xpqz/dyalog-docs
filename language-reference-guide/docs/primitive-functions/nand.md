`Y` must be a Boolean array.  `X` must be a Boolean array.  `R` is Boolean.  The value of `R` is the truth value of the proposition "not both `X` and `Y`", and is determined as follows:
```apl
             X   Y     R
      
             0   0     1
             0   1     1
             1   0     1
             1   1     0
```



**Example**

```apl
      (0 1)(1 0) ⍲ (0 0)(1 1)
 1 1  0 1
```
