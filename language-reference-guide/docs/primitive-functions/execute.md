`Y` must be a simple character scalar or vector containing an APL expression to be executed. The expression may contain one or more sub-expressions separated by `⋄` (Diamond) characters.


If the result of the expression is used or is assigned to a name,  `R` is the result (if any) of the last-executed sub-expression and the non-shy results of all preceding expressions (that are not assigned within the expression) are displayed. Otherwise the unassigned non-shy results of all of the sub-expressions are displayed.


If the expression is an empty vector or a vector containing only blanks or one that does not produce a result, then `⍎Y` has no value and using or assigning it to a name will generate `VALUE ERROR`.



If `Y` contains a branch expression, the branch is effected in the environment from which the Execute was invoked, and `⍎Y` does not return.


If specified, `X` must be a namespace reference or a simple character scalar or vector representing the name of a namespace in which the expression is to be executed. If `X` is omitted or is an empty character vector, the expression is executed in the current space.
