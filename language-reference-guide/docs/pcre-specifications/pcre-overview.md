<h1 class="heading"><span class="name"> PCRE Overview</span></h1>

PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) is an *open source* library used by the
`⎕R` and `⎕S` system operators. The regular expression syntax which the library
supports is not unique to APL nor is it an integral part of the language.

There are two named sections: *pcrepattern*, which
describes the full syntax and semantics); and *prcresyntax*, a quick reference summary.
