I-Beam is a monadic operator that provides a range of system related services.


**WARNING:** Although documentation is provided for I-Beam functions, any service provided using I-Beam should be considered as "experimental" and subject to change – without notice - from one release to the next. Any use of I-Beams in applications should therefore be carefully isolated in cover-functions that can be adjusted if necessary.


`A` is an integer that specifies the type of operation to be performed. `Y` is an array that supplies further information about what is to be done.


`X` may or may not be required depending on `A`.


`R` is the result of the derived function.


For further information, see [I-Beam:](./i-beam.md).
