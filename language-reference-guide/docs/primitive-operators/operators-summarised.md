<h1 class="heading"><span class="name"> Operators Summarised</span></h1>

**Table 1** and **Table 1** below summarise the Monadic and Dyadic primitive operators whose detailed descriptions  follow in alphabetical order in this section.

Some operators may include an axis specification (indicated `[]`in the tables). Note that in these case `⎕IO` is an implicit argument of the derived function.
