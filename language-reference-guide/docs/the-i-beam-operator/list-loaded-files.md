The editor may be used to edit Dyalog script files (*.dyalog* files) and general text files and to save the contents in the workspace. Additionally `⎕FIX` can be used to fix scripts held in files. This I-Beam returns a list of all of the files which are associated with objects in the workspace, together with information about each file.


`Y` may be any value.


`R` is a vector of vectors, one element per associated file. Each element is a 5 element vector:


| Element | Contains |
| --- | ---  |
| 1 | File name |
| 2 | Encoding |
| 3 | Checksum |
| 4 | Newline |
| 5 | Flags |


Encoding, newline and flags are defined the same as for `⎕NGET`. See [File Encodings](../system-functions/nget.md). Checksum is an 8-character hexadecimal value, see [GetBuildID](../../../object-reference/methodorevents/getbuildid)  for more information.
