Identifies how the current function was called. It reports whether the nearest tradfn on the stack was called without a left argument or not.


`Y` may be any array.


The result `R` is Boolean. 1 means that the nearest tradfn was called monadically; 0 means that it wasn't. If there is no function on the stack, the result is 0.
