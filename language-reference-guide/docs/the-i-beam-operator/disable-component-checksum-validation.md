Checksums allow component files to be validated and repaired using [`⎕FCHK`](../system-functions/fchk.md).


From Version 13.1 onwards, components which contain checksums are also validated on every component read.


Although not recommended, applications which favour performance over security may disable checksum validation by `⎕FREAD` using this function.


`Y` is an integer defined as follows:


| Value | Description |
| --- | ---  |
| 0 | `⎕FREAD` will not validate checksums. |
| 1 | `⎕FREAD` will validate checksums when they are present. This is the default. |


The shy result `R` is the previous value of this setting.
