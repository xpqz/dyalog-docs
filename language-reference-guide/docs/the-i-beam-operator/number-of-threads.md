<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Number of Threads</span> <span class="command">R←1111⌶Y</span></h1>



Specifies how many threads are to be used for parallel execution.


If `Y` has the value `⍬`, `R` is the number of virtual processors in the machine.


Otherwise, `Y` is an integer that specifies the number of threads that are to be used henceforth for parallel execution. Prior to this call, the default number of threads is specified by the parameter  `APL_MAX_THREADS`. See [ APL_MAX_THREADS](../../../windows-installation-and-configuration-guide/configuration-parameters/configuration-parameters).


Note that whatever the value of `Y`, Dyalog limits the number of threads to 64. So the effective number of threads is `Y⌊64`.



`R` is the previous value.


To set the number of threads to be the same as the number of virtual processors, execute the stamement:
```apl
      {}1111⌶ 1111⌶⍬
```

        ](../../../programming-reference-guide/introduction/parallel-execution) and [Parallel Execution Threshold](parallel-execution-threshold.md).
