<h1 class="heading"><span class="name"> System Constants</span></h1>

System constants, which can be regarded as niladic system functions, return information from the system.  They have distinguished names, beginning with the quad symbol, `⎕`.  A system constant may **not** be assigned a value.  System constants may not be localised or erased. System constants are summarised in the following table:
