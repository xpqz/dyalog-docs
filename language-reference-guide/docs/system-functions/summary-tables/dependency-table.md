<h1 class="heading"><span class="name"> Dependency Table</span></h1>

The following table describes the dependencies that exist between functions, operators and system variables.

| System Variable | Monadic Functions | Dyadic Functions | Operators |
| --- | --- | --- | ---  |
| `⎕ML` | `∊ ↑ ↓ ≡` | `⊂[K]` | `` |
| `⎕IO` | `⍒ ⍋ ⍳ ?` | `? ⍋ ⍒ ⌷ ⍳ ⊃ ⍉` | `⌸ []` |
| `⎕RL` | `?` | `?` | `` |
| `⎕CT` | `⌈ ⌊ ∪` | `⍷ ≡ ≢ ∩ ∪ ~ ⍳ ∊ | < ≤ = ≥ > ≠ ∧ ∨ (non-Boolean)` | `⍤` |
| `⎕DCT` | `⌈ ⌊ ∪` | `⍷ ≡ ≢ ∩ ∪ ~ ⍳ ∊ | < ≤ = ≥ > ≠ ∧ ∨ (non-Boolean)` | `⍤` |
| `⎕DIV` | `÷` | `÷` | `` |
| `⎕PP` | `⍕` | `` | `` |
