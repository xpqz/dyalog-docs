`Y` is a simple scalar or vector of thread numbers.


`R` is a vector containing the concatenated token requests for all the threads specified in `Y`. This is effectively the result of catenating all of the right arguments together for all threads in `Y` that are currently executing `⎕TGET`.



**Example**

```apl
    ⎕TREQ ⎕TNUMS    ⍝ tokens required by all threads.
```
