This system function is implemented for compatibility with other versions of APL but currently performs no useful function.  Its purpose is to obtain a list of outstanding shared variable offers made to you, to which you have not yet responded.


Using DDE as the communication protocol, it is not possible to implement `⎕SVQ` effectively.
