## Access code 8


`Y` must be a simple integer scalar or a 1 or 2 element vector containing the file tie number followed by an optional passnumber.  If the passnumber is omitted it is assumed to be zero. Subject to a few restrictions, `X` may be any array.


The shy result `R` is the number of the component to which `X` is written, and is 1 greater than the previously highest component number in the file, or 1 if the file is new.
