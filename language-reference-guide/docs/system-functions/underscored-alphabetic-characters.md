`⎕Ⓐ` is a deprecated feature. Dyalog **strongly** recommends that you move away from the use of `⎕Ⓐ` and of the underscored alphabet itself, as these symbols now constitute the sole remaining non-standard use of characters in Dyalog applications.


In Versions of Dyalog APL prior to Version 11.0, `⎕Ⓐ` was a simple character vector, composed of the letters of the alphabet with underscores. If the Dyalog Alt font was in use, these symbols displayed as additional National Language characters.

#### Version 10.1 and Earlier
```apl
      ⎕Ⓐ
ⒶⒷⒸⒹⒺⒻⒼⒽⒾⒿⓀⓁⓂⓃⓄⓅⓆⓇⓈⓉⓊⓋⓌⓍⓎⓏ
```


For compatibility with previous versions of Dyalog APL, functions that contain references to `⎕Ⓐ` will continue to return characters with the same *index* in `⎕AV` as before. However, the display of `⎕Ⓐ` is now `⎕Á`, and the old underscored symbols appear as they did in previous Versions when the Dyalog Alt font was in use.

#### Current Version
```apl
