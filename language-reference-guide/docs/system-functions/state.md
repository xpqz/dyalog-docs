`Y` must be a simple character scalar or vector which is taken to be the name of an APL object or a system variable. The result returned is a nested vector of 4 elements as described below. `⎕STATE` supplies information about shadowed or localised objects that is otherwise unobtainable.


|---|---|
|`1⊃R`|Boolean vector, element set to 1 if and only if this level shadows `Y` . Note: `(⍴1⊃R)=⍴⎕LC`|
|`2⊃R`|Numeric vector giving the stack state of this name as it entered this level. Note: `(⍴2⊃R)=⍴⎕LC` 0=not on stack 1=suspended 2=pendent (may also be suspended) 3=active (may also be pendent or suspended)|
|`3⊃R`|Numeric vector giving the name classification of `Y` as it entered this level. Note: `(⍴3⊃R)=+/1⊃R`|
|`4⊃R`|Vector giving the contents of `Y` before it was shadowed at this level. Note: `(⍴4⊃R)=+/0≠3⊃R`|
