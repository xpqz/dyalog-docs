Dyalog includes a collection of built-in facilities which provide various services related to both the APL and the external environment. They have distinguished case-insensitive names beginning with the `⎕` symbol and are implicitly available in a clear workspace. Collectively, these  facilities are  referred to as System *Functions* but  they are variously implemented as constants, variables, functions, operators, and in one case, as a namespace.

Note that Dyalog may extend any of these facilities by, for example, adding extra elements, rows or columns to a result, so code should take this possibility into account.
