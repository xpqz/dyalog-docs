This monadic function reads data from a native file. `Y` is a 3- or 4-element integer vector whose elements are as follows:


|---|---|
|`[1]`|negative tie number,|
|`[2]`|conversion code (see below),|
|`[3]`|count. If this value is `¯1` , all of the elements defined by `Y[2]` are read from the position specified by `Y[4]` to the end of the file. This may result in the last few bytes in the file being ignored if they do not form a complete element.|
|`[4]`|start byte, counting from 0. If this value omitted or is `¯1` , data is read starting from the current position in the file (initially `0` ).|


#### Notes


`8 ⎕NINFO ⊃Y` can be used to report the current position of the file pointer.


`Y[2]` specifies conversion to an APL internal form as follows. Note that the internal formats for character arrays differ between the Unicode and Classic Editions.


If both `Y[3]` and `Y[4]` have the value `¯1`, then `⎕NREAD` reads data from the current position in the file to the end of the file.


`⎕NREAD` can be used with any file. However, calling `⎕NREAD` with at least one of `Y[3 4]` set to `¯1` is intended for regular files only; using on pipes, FIFOs or other special types of file is not recommended.

Note that types **80, 160** and **320** and **83** and **163** are exclusive to Dyalog APL.



**Example**

```apl

      DATA←⎕NREAD ¯1 160 (0.5×⎕NSIZE ¯1) 0 ⍝ Unicode
      DATA←⎕NREAD ¯1 82 (⎕NSIZE ¯1) 0      ⍝ Classic
      DATA←⎕NREAD ¯1 82 ¯1 0       ⍝ Shorter version

```




[^1]: Conversion code 82 is permitted in the Unicode Edition for compatibility and causes 1-byte data on file to be translated (according to ⎕NXLATE ) from ⎕AV indices into normal (Unicode) characters of type 80, 160 or 320.
