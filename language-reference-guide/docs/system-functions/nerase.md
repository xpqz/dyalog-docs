This function erases (deletes) a tied native file.  `Y` is a negative integer tie number associated with a tied native file.  `X` is a simple character vector or scalar containing the name of the same file and must be **identical** to the name used when it was opened by `⎕NCREATE` or `⎕NTIE`.


The shy result of `⎕NERASE` is the tie number that the erased file had.



**Example**

```apl
      file ⎕nerase file ⎕ntie 0
```
