##### Access code 4


`Y` must be a simple integer scalar or 1 or 2 element vector containing the file tie number followed by an optional passnumber.  If the passnumber is omitted it is assumed to be zero.  `X` must be a character scalar or vector containing the name of the file associated with the tie number `Y`.  This name must be identical with the name used to tie the file (except that the directory delimiters `/` and `\` are treated as being the same) and the file must be exclusively tied.  The file named in `X` is erased and untied.


The shy result of `⎕FERASE` is the tie number of the erased file.
