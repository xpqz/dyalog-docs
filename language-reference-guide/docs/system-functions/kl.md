`Y` is a simple character vector or a vector of character vectors containing Input Codes for Keyboard Shortcuts. In the Classic Edition, keystrokes are associated with Keyboard Shortcuts by the Input Translate Table.


`R` is a simple character vector or a vector of character vectors containing the labels associated with the codes.  If `Y` specifies codes that are not defined, the corresponding elements of `R` are the codes in `Y`.


`⎕KL` provides the information required to build device-independent help messages into applications, particularly full-screen applications using `⎕SM` and `⎕SR`.
