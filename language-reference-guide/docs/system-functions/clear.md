A clear workspace is activated, having the name `CLEAR WS`.  The active workspace is lost.  All system variables assume their default values.  The maximum size of workspace is available.


Apart from .NET objects, the contents of the session namespace `⎕SE` are not affected. .NET objects in `⎕SE` are disconnected from .NET because `⎕CLEAR` closes the current .NET AppDomain.

```apl

      ⎕CLEAR
      ⎕WSID
CLEAR WS
```
