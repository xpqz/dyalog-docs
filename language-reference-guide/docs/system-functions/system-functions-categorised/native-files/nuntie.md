This closes one or more native files.  `Y` is a scalar or vector of negative integer tie numbers.  The files associated with elements of `Y` are closed.  Native file untie with a zero length argument (`⎕NUNTIE ⍬`) flushes all file buffers to disk - see [File Untie:](funtie.md) for more explanation.


The shy result of `⎕NUNTIE` is a vector of tie numbers of the files **actually untied**.
