This system function terminates communication via one or more shared variables, or aborts shared variable offers that have not yet been accepted.


`Y` is a character scalar, vector or matrix.  If it is a vector it contains a shared variable name and optionally its external name or surrogate separated from it by one of more blanks.  If `Y` is a scalar, it specifies a single 1-character name.  If `Y` is a matrix, each row of `Y` specifies a name and an optional external name as for the vector case.


The result `R` is vector whose length corresponds to the number of names specified by Y, indicating the level of sharing of each variable after retraction.


See ["Shared Variable State: "](svs.md) for further information on the possible states of a shared variable.
