The value of `⎕DCT` determines the precision with which two numbers are judged to be equal when the value of `⎕FR` is 1287. If `⎕FR` is 645, the system uses `⎕CT`.


`⎕DCT` may be assigned any value in the range from `0` to `2*¯32` (about `2.3283064365386962890625E¯10`). A value of `0` ensures exact comparison. The value in a clear workspace is `1E¯28`. `⎕DCT` has Namespace scope.



`⎕CT` and `⎕DCT` are implicit arguments of the monadic primitive functions Ceiling (`⌈`), Floor (`⌊`) and Unique (`∪`), and of the dyadic functions Equal (`=`), Excluding (`~`), Find (`⍷`), Greater (`>`), Greater or Equal (`≥`), Greatest Common Divisor (`∨`), Index of (`⍳`), Intersection (`∩`), Less (`<`), Less or Equal (`≤`), Lowest Common Multiple (`∧`), Match (`≡`), Membership (`∊`), Not Match (`≢`), Not Equal (`≠`), Residue (`|`) and Union (`∪`), as well as `⎕FMT` O-format.
