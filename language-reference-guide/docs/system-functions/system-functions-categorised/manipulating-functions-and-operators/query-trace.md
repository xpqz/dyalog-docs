`Y` must be a simple character scalar or vector which is taken to be the name of a visible defined function or operator.  `R` is a simple non-negative integer vector of the line numbers of the function or operator named by `Y` on which trace controls are set, shown in ascending order.  The value 0 in `R` indicates that a trace control is set to display the result of the function or operator immediately prior to exit.
