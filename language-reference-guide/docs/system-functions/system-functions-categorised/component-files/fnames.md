The result is a character matrix containing the names of all tied files, with one file name per row.  The number of columns is that required by the longest file name.


A file name is returned precisely as it was specified when the file was tied, except that the directory delimiter `\` is replaced by `/`.  If no files are tied, the result is a character matrix with 0 rows and 0 columns.  The rows of the result are in the order in which the files were tied.
