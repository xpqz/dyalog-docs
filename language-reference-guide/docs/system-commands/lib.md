This command lists the names of Dyalog workspaces contained in the given directory.

If a directory is not given, the workspaces on the user's APL workspace path (**WSPATH**) are listed.  In this case, the listing is divided into sections identifying the directories concerned.  The current directory is identified as "`.`".

```apl
      )LIB
