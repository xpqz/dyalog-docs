This command displays the names of global **namespaces** in the active workspace.  Names are displayed in the `⎕AV` collating order.  If a name is included after the command, only those names starting at or after the given name in collating order are displayed.  Namespaces are objects created using `⎕NS`, `)NS` or `⎕WC` and have name class 9.


Note:  `)OBS` can be used as an **alternative** to `)OBJECTS`
