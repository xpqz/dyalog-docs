This command saves the active workspace in the current working directory and ends the Dyalog session. The name of the workspace file is CONTINUE in upper-case with the extension defined by the [`WSEXT` parameter](../../../windows-installation-and-configuration-guide/configuration-parameters/configuration-parameters).


Note that the values of all system variables (including `⎕SM`) and GUI objects are also saved in `CONTINUE`.


When a `CONTINUE` workspace is loaded, the latent expression (if any) is NOT executed.
