<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Workspace Identification</span> <span class="command">)WSID {ws}</span></h1>



This command displays or sets the name of the active workspace.


If a workspace name is not specified, `)WSID` reports the name of the current active workspace.  The name reported is the full path name, including directory references.


If a workspace name is given, the current active workspace is renamed accordingly.  The previous name of the active workspace (excluding directory references) is reported.  See [Programmer's Guide: "Workspaces"](../../../programming-reference-guide/introduction/workspaces) for the rules for specifying a workspace name.
