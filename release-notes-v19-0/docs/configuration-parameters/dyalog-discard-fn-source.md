<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">DYALOG_DISCARD_FN_SOURCE</span></h1>

This Boolean parameter specifies whether (1) or not (0) source code is discarded from the workspace when an object is fixed. The default value is 0 which means that source code is retained in the workspace and will subsequently be presented for editing as it had been saved previously.

For further information, see [Discard Source Information](../language-reference-changes/discard-source-information.md) and [Source as Typed](../introduction/source-as-typed.md).
