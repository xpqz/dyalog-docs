Increases the amount of workspace allocated to internal hash tables. These tables are created when a set primitive is executed or by the Hash Array function (`1500⌶`).

#### Note


**The purpose of this function is to allow the user to evaluate potential side-effects of the proposed increase in table size in the next major version of Dyalog.**


`Y` may be ⍬, or an integer 0, 1, 2, or 3.


If `Y` is 1, 2 or 3 the hash table size is increased by the factor `2*Y`. If `Y` is 0, the hash table size is reset to its default value. In these cases, the shy result `R` is the previous value of the scale factor.


If `Y` is ⍬ the size is unaffected and the (non-shy) result is the current value of the scale factor.


It is recommended that users test their code using the maximum value 3.
