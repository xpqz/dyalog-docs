<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Configuration Parameters</span></h1>

Dyalog can be customised using configuration parameters. These can be set in various ways; if a configuration parameter is set in multiple places the following descending order of precedence applies:

1. command line settings
2. application configuration file settings
3. environment variable settings
4. user configuration file settings
5. built-in defaults

This provides a great deal of flexibility, enabling a user to override one setting with another. For example, a "usual" workspace size (**MAXWS**) can be defined in the user configuration file, but be temporarily superseded by entering a different value when starting a Dyalog Session from the command line.

For more information on configuration files, see [Configuration Files](configuration-files.md). For more information on environment variables, see [Environment Variables](environment-variables.md).
