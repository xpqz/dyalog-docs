<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Window Captions</span></h1>

The captions of the various windows that comprise the Dyalog Integrated Development Environment (IDE) are user-configurable and defined by entries in the Windows registry in the *Captions* subkey of the main Dyalog key.

Note that this only applies when the windows are floating (un-docked). When a window is docked Dyalog displays a fixed non-configurable caption.

Note also that the *Captions* subkey is not created by the interpreter; the user must create the subkey and the values.

Each entry is a string value whose name identifies the window as follows:

|Window Name   |Description                                                                                                                       |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Session       |The main Dyalog APL session window                                                                                                |

Each string value should contain a mixture of your own text and keywords which are enclosed in braces, for example, {TITLE}. Keywords act like variables and are replaced at display time by corresponding values as described in the table below.

|Keyword    |Value                                                                |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`{TITLE}`  |The window name shown in the first column of the previous table      |
|`{WSID}`   |Workspace ID ( `⎕WSID` )                                             |
|`{NSID}`   |Current Namespace                                                    |
|`{SNSID}`  |Current Namespace (short version)                                    |
|`{PRODUCT}`|The name of the Dyalog product, for example, "Dyalog APL/W - 64"     |
|`{VER_A}`  |The main version number, for example, "14"                           |
|`{VER_B}`  |The secondary version number, for example, "0"                       |
|`{VER_C}`  |The tertiary  version number (currently the internal revision number)|
|`{PID}`    |The process ID                                                       |
|`{CHARS}`  |"Classic" or "Unicode"                                               |
|`{BITS}`   |"32" or "64"                                                         |
|`{XLOC}`   |The namespace currently being explored (Explorer only)               |

For example, if the Registry contains *.\Captions\Session* whose value is:
```apl
    My APL ({WSID}) Version {VER_A}.{VER_B}[{VER_C}]  - {PID}
```

then the caption displayed in a new Dyalog APL Session window might be:
```apl
    My APL (CLEAR WS) Version 14.0[20105] - 4616
```
