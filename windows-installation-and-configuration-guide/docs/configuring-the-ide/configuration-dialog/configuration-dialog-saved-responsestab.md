The *Saved Responses* tab of the *Configuration* dialog is used to remove preferences that the user has previously established.

In the example illustrated above, the user has at some point chosen to save a text file with a `.h` extension as text in the workspace and, by checking the option *Save this response for all files with a ".h" extension*, saved this as a preference for all such text files. Similarly, the user has checked the option *Do not show this message again* when responding to the warning dialog *Saving as text will ...*.

If the user wishes to reverse these decisions, even temporarily, it is necessary to select the corresponding option /preference name(s) and click *Delete*. The names are intended to be self-explanatory and are not listed here.
