To alter the keystroke associated with a particular action, simply select the action required and press the keystroke. For example, to change the keystroke associated with the action <UA> (undo all changes) from (None) to Ctrl+Shift+u, simply select the corresponding row in the list and press Ctrl+Shift+u. If *Confirm before Overwrite* is checked, you will be prompted to confirm or cancel before each and every change is written back to the registry.

Note that clicking on the column headings will sort on that column; shift and mouse click will sort in reverse order.
