<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">The APL Command Line</span></h1>

The command line for Dyalog APL is described below; the command line for non-Windows versions of Dyalog APL is very similar and is also documented in *Dyalog for UNIX UI Guide: Starting APL*.

Usually the command line is specified in the Target: field of the APL shortcut. The full pathname to the Dyalog executable is usually surrounded by double quotes as it contains spaces.

## Command Line

dyalog [ options ] [ debug ] [ ws ] [param] [param] [param]...

where:

**[dyalog]**

Is the location of the Dyalog executable. Usually this is the full pathname, surrounded by double quotes.

**[options]**

|---|---|
|-x|Disables the execution of the `⎕LX` expression and the derived expression when code is loaded from a source code file or directory.  This applies only at start-up and does not apply to workspaces or source files that are loaded subsequently. See [Latent Expression](../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/lx) and [Load](configuration-parameters/load.md)|
|-a|Start in USER mode.|
|-b|Suppress the banner in the Session..|
|-s|Disable the Session. This option is ignored in Windows versions.|
|+s|Force the display of the Session when it would otherwise not be shown.|
|-q|Don't quit APL on error (used when piping input into APL).|
|+q|Quit APL on error. In earlier versions of Dyalog, quitting on error saved a workspace with the reserved name CONTINUE; this behaviour can be re-enabled using `2704⌶`. See [Continue Autosave](../../language-reference-guide/the-i-beam-operator/continue-autosave) .|
|-c|Signifies a command-line comment. All characters to the right are ignored.|
|-cef -cef_all|Instructs Dyalog to ignore the parameter that immediately follows or all the parameters that follow. These options are intended to isolate parameters intended for the built-in Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF). See [HTMLRenderer](../../object-reference/objects/htmlrenderer) .|

**[debug]**

|---|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|-Dc|Check workspace integrity after every callback function.                                   |
|-Dw|Check workspace integrity on return to session input.                                      |
|-DW|Check workspace integrity after every line of APL (application will run slowly as a result)|
|-DK|Log session keystrokes in (binary) file **./apllog** .                                     |

**[ws]**

The name of a Dyalog APL workspace to be loaded. Unless specified, on Windows the file extension .DWS is assumed.

**[param]**

A parameter name followed by an equals sign (`=`) and a value. The parameter name may be one of the standard APL parameters (see [Configuration Parameters](configuration-parameters.md) ) or a name and value of your own choosing (see [GetEnvironment](../../object-reference/methodorevents/getenvironment) ) . If the parameter is in a registry sub-folder (see [Registry Sub-Folders](registry-subfolders.md) ), its name must be preceded by the name of the sub-folder, followed by a backslash (`\`) or underscore (`_`).

!!! note
    Instead of  a loading a workspace specified by the **ws** option, APL can be instructed to load a program from a script file. For further information, see [Load](configuration-parameters/load.md).

<h2 class="example">Examples</h2>

Start APL using the configuration file `myconfig.dcfg`:
```apl
   "c:\program files\…\dyalog.exe" ConfigFile="myconfig.dcfg"
```

Load the workspace `myapp`, setting **MaxWS** parameter:
```apl
   "c:\program files\…\dyalog.exe" myapp maxws=2G
```

Load the workspace `myapp`, set an application specific parameter, but do not execute the latent expression:
```apl
   "c:\program files\…\dyalog.exe" -x myapp myparam=8080
```

Run the function defined in `myfn.aplf`:
```apl
   "c:\program files\…\dyalog.exe" load=myfn.aplf
```

Start APL and output "Hello World":
```apl
   "c:\program files\…\dyalog.exe" lx="⎕←'Hello World'"
```
