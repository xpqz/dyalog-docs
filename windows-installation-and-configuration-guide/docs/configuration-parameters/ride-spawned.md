<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">RIDE_Spawned</span></h1>

If non-zero, this parameter disables `⎕SR` and `)SH` which instead generate `DOMAIN ERROR`. This parameter is used to prevent certain user-interfaces from being executed from a RIDE session which does not support them, and which would otherwise cause the RIDE session to become unresponsive. See *RIDE User Guide*.
