<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Greet_Bitmap</span></h1>

This parameter specifies the filename of a bitmap to be displayed during initialisation of the Dyalog APL application. It is used typically to display a product logo from a runtime application. The bitmap will remain until either an error occurs, or it is removed using the [GreetBitmap](../../../object-reference/methodorevents/greetbitmap) method of the Root object.
```apl
Greet_Bitmap=c:\myapp\logo.bmp
```
