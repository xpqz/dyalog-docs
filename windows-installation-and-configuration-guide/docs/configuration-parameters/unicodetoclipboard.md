<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">UnicodeToClipboard</span></h1>

**Classic Edition only.**

This parameter specifies whether or not text that is transferred to and from the Windows clipboard is treated as Unicode text. If **UnicodeToClipboard** is 0 (the default), the symbols in `⎕AV` are mapped to ASCII text (0-255). In particular, the APL symbols are mapped to ASCII symbols according to their positions in the Dyalog APL font. If **UnicodeToClipboard** is 1, the symbols in `⎕AV` are mapped to Unicode text and the APL symbols are mapped to their genuine Unicode equivalent values.
