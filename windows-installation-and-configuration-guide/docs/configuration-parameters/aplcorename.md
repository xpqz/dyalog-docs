This parameter specifies the directory and name of the file in which*aplcore* should be saved. The optional wild-card character (*) is replaced by a number when the file is written. If there is more than one "*" in **AplCoreName**, the string is used as is; no substitution is made. For more details, including how to prevent aplcore files from being generated, see [ MaxAplCores.](maxaplcores.md)

Note that APL terminates with an exit code of 3 when an aplcore file is generated.
