<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">ClassicModeSavePosition</span></h1>

This parameter specifies whether or not the current size and location of the first of the editor and tracer windows are remembered for next time. 
 This applies only if **ClassicMode** is 1.  See [ ClassicMode](./classicmode.md).

The size and location of the windows are saved in the registry in the subfolder WindowRects/EditWindow and TraceWindow.
