<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">DYALOG_EVENTLOGNAME</span></h1>

This parameter applies under Windows only, and is either the name of the event log to which an event message will be written, or the source of the event message (depending on the registry entries which may or may not have been defined) when Dyalog APL would pop up a message box due to an unexpected termination of Dyalog APL.See 
		[Handling Unexpected Application Errors in Windows](../../../programming-reference-guide/error-trapping/handling-unexpected-errors) for more information.
