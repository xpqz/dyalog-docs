<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Adding a Quit Button</span></h1>

Finally, we will add a "Quit" button, attaching the same `QUIT` function as a callback, but this time to the Select event which occurs when the user presses it.

Instead of having a default sized button, we will make it nice and big, and position it centrally.

To make the statement fit on the page, it is split into three. The Posn and Size properties are explicitly named for clarity.
```apl
      QB←'Button' '&Quit' ('Posn' 70 30)
      QB,←('Size' ⍬ 40)('Event' 'Select' 'QUIT')
      'TEMP.Q' ⎕WC QB
```

Notice how the ampersand (&) in the Caption is used to specify the *mnemonic* (short-cut) key. This can be used to press the button instead of clicking the mouse.
