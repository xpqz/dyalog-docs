<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Adding a Fahrenheit Edit Field</span></h1>

Now let's add the edit field for Fahrenheit. We will call it `F` and place it alongside the label, but 40% along. Initially the field will be empty. We will make it 20% wide but let its height default. `⎕WC` will make it just big enough to fit the current font height. As the field is to handle numbers, we will set its FieldType to `'Numeric'`.
```apl
'TEMP.F' ⎕WC 'Edit' '' (10 40)(⍬ 20)('FieldType' 'Numeric')
```
