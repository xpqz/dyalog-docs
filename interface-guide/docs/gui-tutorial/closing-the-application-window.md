<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Closing the Application Window</span></h1>

Then we need something to allow our user to terminate our application. He will expect the application to terminate when he closes the window. We will implement this by having a callback function called `QUIT` which will simply call `⎕OFF`, that is:
```apl
     ∇ QUIT
[1]   ⎕OFF
     ∇
```

We can associate this with the Close event on the Form `TEMP`. This event will be generated when the user closes the window from its System Menu
```apl
      TEMP.onClose←'QUIT'
```

Although here we have used assignment to set the Event property, we could just as easily have defined it when we created the Form by adding `('Event' 'Close' 'QUIT')` to the right argument of `⎕WC`.
