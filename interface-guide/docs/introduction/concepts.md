The Dyalog APL GUI is based upon four important concepts; **objects**, **properties**, **events** and **methods**.

## Objects

Objects are instances of classes that contain information and provide functionality. Most Dyalog APL objects are GUI objects that may be displayed on the screen and with which you can interact. An example of an object is a push-button (an instance of class Button) which you may press to cause the program to take a particular action. Objects are defined in hierarchies.

Objects are also **namespaces** and may contain functions, variables, and indeed other namespaces. This allows you to store the code and data that is required by a given object *within* that object. Functions and variables stored in an object are hidden and protected from conflicts with functions and variables in the outside workspace and with those in other objects.

## Properties

Each object has an associated set of properties which describe how it looks and behaves. For example, a Button has a property called Caption which defines the character string to be displayed in it. It also has a property called Type which may be Push (the button appears to move in and out when it is *pressed*), Radio (the button has two states and may be toggled on and off); and so forth.

## Events

During interaction with the user, an object is capable of generating events. There are essentially two types of event, **raw** events and **object** events. **Raw** events are typically associated with a particular hardware operation. Pressing a mouse button, pressing a key on the keyboard, or moving the mouse pointer are examples of raw events. An **object** event is generated by some action that is specific to the object in question, but which may typically be achieved by a variety of hardware operations.

An example is the Select event. For a Button object, this event is generated when the user *presses* the Button. In MS-Windows, this can be done in several ways. Firstly, the user may click the left mouse button over the object. Secondly, under certain circumstances, the Select event can be generated when the user presses the Enter key. Finally, the event will occur if the user presses a "short-cut" (mnemonic) key that is associated with the Button.

## Methods

Methods are effectively functions that an object provides; they are things that you may invoke to make the object do something for you. In Dyalog APL, the distinction between methods and events is tenuous, because events also make objects perform actions and you may generate events under program control. For example, a Scroll event is generated by a scrollbar when the user moves the thumb. Conversely, you can make a scrollbar scroll by generating a Scroll event. Nevertheless, the concept of a method is useful to describe functions that can only be invoked by a program and are not directly accessible to the user.

## Objects

The following objects are supported.

## Implementation Overview

The Dyalog APL GUI is implemented by the following system functions :

|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
|[`⎕DQ`](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/dq)|Dequeue        |processes user actions, invoking callbacks  |
|[`⎕NQ`](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/nq)|Enqueue        |generates an event under program control    |
|[`⎕WC`](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/wc)|Create Object  |creates new object with specified properties|
|[`⎕WG`](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/wg)|Get Properties |gets values of properties from an object    |
|[`⎕WN`](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/wn)|Object Names   |reports names of all children of an object  |
|[`⎕WS`](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/ws)|Set Properties |sets values of properties for an object     |

GUI Objects are a special type of *namespace* and have a name class of 9. They may therefore be managed like any other workspace object. This means that they can be localised in function headers and erased with `⎕EX`. GUI objects are saved with your workspace and reappear when it is loaded or copied.
