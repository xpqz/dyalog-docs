This manual describes various interfaces between Dyalog APL and Windows.

Chapter 1 introduces the concepts of the Dyalog APL Graphical User Interface (GUI) and describes, in outline, how the system works.

Chapter 2 contains a tutorial which takes you step-by-step through the implementation of a simple GUI application.

Chapters 3 explains how to draw graphics using primitive graphical objects such as Poly, Bitmap and Metafile objects.

Chapter 4 describes how to use toolbars, tab controls and status bars.

Chapter 6 covers the important Grid object that provides a spreadsheet interface for displaying and editing tables of data and

Chapters 7 and 8 describe the Multiple Document Interface (MDI) and docking. Further GUI material is provided in the WTUTOR, WTUTOR95 and WDESIGN workspaces.

Chapters 9-11 describe the various ways in which Dyalog APL may communicate with other Windows applications using  Component Object Model (COM) interfaces. These interfaces allow APL to act as an OLE Automation server and client, and allow you to write ActiveX controls in Dyalog APL.

Chapter 12 describes the DDE interface which is implemented using (traditional) APL shared variables. However, please note that DDE has all but been replaced by COM, and is no longer promoted as a major technology by Microsoft.
