An *ActiveX Control* is basically a user-defined control that may be included in GUI applications and Web Browsers.

This chapter describes how you write ActiveX Controls in Dyalog APL/W.

A Dyalog APL ActiveX Control can be used by any other application that supports ActiveX. Such applications include Microsoft Visual Basic, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator with the NCompass ScriptActive Plug-In and of course Dyalog APL itself.

This chapter also includes a tutorial which teaches you how to:

- Create an ActiveX control in Dyalog APL
- Define and Export Properties, Methods and Events
- Include your ActiveX control in a Visual basic application
- Run your ActiveX control from a Web Browser.

The examples described in this Chapter were developed and tested  using the 32-bit version of Dyalog APL 15.0 Unicode and Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015. Note that the Visual Studio IDE does not support 64-bit ActiveX controls, so you cannot run the tutorial using the 64-bit version of Dyalog.
