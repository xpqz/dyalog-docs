# Dyalog APL Help

Welcome to Dyalog APL's online Help and Documentation for Version {{ version_majmin }}.

Documentation is available in two formats: Help systems and PDF files.

## Help Systems:

* Pressing &lt;F1&gt; when the cursor is positioned after a primitive function or operator symbol, the name of a system function, etc. will open the appropriate page in the help system (offline under Microsoft Windows, online with Ride).

* Note: The help system only includes a subset of the complete documentation set; the full set is available as PDF files.

* There is also online help at https://docs.dyalog.com/{{ version_majmin }}/

## PDF Files:

* All of the documentation supplied with a release of Dyalog APL resides in the `help` subdirectory of the Dyalog installation and in the Documentation Centre.

* If you want to print any of the manuals that form part of the Help system, then PDFs suitable for printing are available at https://docs.dyalog.com/{{ version_majmin }}; the offline PDFs supplied with the release are intended for on-screen browsing.

If you are using Dyalog under Microsoft Windows, then the Documentation Centre (offline) can be accessed under the Help menu in the Session.

If you are using the Ride, then the Documentation Centre (online) can be accessed under the Help menu in the Session.

The documentation is updated throughout the life of each version of Dyalog; the latest versions of the files and the online help for all supported versions are available at https://docs.dyalog.com.

If you report an issue with the documentation, could you please include the following information in your report: Version {{ version_majmin }}, revision {{ build_date }}:{{ git_info }}.

Please note that unless otherwise stated, all the examples in the documentation assume `⎕IO` is 1, and `⎕ML` is 1.
