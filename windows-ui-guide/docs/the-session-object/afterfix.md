|-----------|-----------------------------|
|Applies To:|[Editor](./session-object.md)|


**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported immediately after the Editor has successfully fixed a new object, or a new version of an object, in the workspace.


You may not nullify or modify the event with a 0-returning callback, nor may you generate the event using `⎕NQ`, or call it as a method. However, returning 0 from a callback will cause the Edit window to remain open if the user action was Fix and Exit (EP).


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 7-element vector as follows :
