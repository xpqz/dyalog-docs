<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">The Session Status Bar</span></h1>

The session status bar is represented by two CoolBands each of which contains a StatusBar object. There are a number of StatusFields as illustrated below. Your own status bar may be configured differently.

The StatusField objects owned by the session StatusBar may have special values of Style, which are used for operations relevant only to the Session. These styles are summarised in the tables shown below.

## Toggle Status Fields

In the default Session files distributed with this release, the Statusfields used to display the value of `⎕IO`, the state of the Insert key (Ins/Rep) and the current keyboard mode (for example, Apl/Uni) have callback functions attached to MouseDblClick. This means that you can toggle the state of these fields by double-clicking with the left mouse button.

If you dislike this behaviour, you may set the Event property of the StatusFields to 0 and re-save the Session file. Alternatively, you may modify the buildse workspace and rebuild the Session from scratch.
