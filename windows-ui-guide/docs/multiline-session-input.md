<h1 class="heading"><span class="name"> Multi-line Session Input</span></h1>

The Session allows multi-line input. This feature is optional and is controlled by the value of the **Dyalog_LineEditor_Mode** parameter which by default is 0 (off). To enable the new behaviour, you must set the parameter to 1.

See [Dyalog_LineEditor_Mode.](../../windows-installation-and-configuration-guide/configuration-parameters/dyalog-lineeditor-mode)

On Windows Multi-line input can be enabled and disabled via the checkbox on the Session tab of the configuration parameter: see [Dyalog_LineEditor_Mode](configuration-dialog-session-tab.md).

### When Multi-line Input is Enabled

- The session considers all related lines to be a *group*.
- Grouped lines are syntax coloured as a whole.
- If a change is made to one or more lines in a group then the whole group is marked to be re-executed when `ER` is pressed.
- Lines can be inserted into a group with the `IL` keystroke.
- The current line can be cleared with the `EL` keystroke. (It is not possible to UNDO a delete line in the session).
- if the interpreter detects an un-terminated control structure or dfn on a single line of input it:enters a new multi-line mode which accumulates lines until the control structure or dfn is terminated.executes a completed block of lines as if it were within a niladic defined function.
- enters a new multi-line mode which accumulates lines until the control structure or dfn is terminated.
- executes a completed block of lines as if it were within a niladic defined function.

Multi-line input can be terminated by correctly terminating the input. For example, if you started a block of multi-line input with a `{` character, then a matching and similarly nested `}` character terminates it. Similarly, if you started a block of multi-line input with `:If` then a matching and similarly nested `:EndIf` terminates it. Issuing a weak interrupt aborts the multi-line input and all changes are lost.
