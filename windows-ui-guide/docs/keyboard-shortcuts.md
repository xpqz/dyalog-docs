<h1 class="heading"><span class="name"> Keyboard Shortcuts</span></h1>

The terms keyboard shortcut (Unicode Edition) and command (Classic Edition) are used herein to describe a keystroke that generates an action, rather than one that produces a symbol.

### Unicode Edition

Unicode Edition provides a number of shortcut keys that may be used to perform actions. For compatibility with Classic Edition and with previous Versions of Dyalog APL, these are identified by 2-character codes; for example the action to start the Tracer is identified by the code <TC>, and mapped to user-configurable keystrokes.

In the Unicode Edition, Keyboard Shortcuts are defined using Options/Configure/Keyboard Shortcuts and stored in the Windows Registry.  Note that the Unicode IME translate tables have definitions for the Keyboard Shortcuts too; these are ignored by the interpreter, and are intended for use with terminal emulators being used in conjunction with non-GUI versions of Dyalog APL.

To the right of the last symbol in the Language Bar is the Keyboard Shortcut icon ![keyboard shortcut icon](img/keyboard-shortcut-icon.png). If you hover the mouse over this icon, a pop-up tip is displayed to remind you of your keyboard shortcuts as illustrated below.

### Classic Edition

Commands fall into four categories, namely cursor movement, selection, editing directives and special operations, and are summarised in the following tables. The input codes in the first column of the tables are the codes by which the commands are identified in the Input Translate Table.
