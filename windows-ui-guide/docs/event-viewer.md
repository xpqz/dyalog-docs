<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">The Event Viewer</span></h1>

The *Event Viewer* can be used to monitor events on Dyalog APL GUI objects. To display the *Event Viewer*, select *Event Viewer* from the *Session Tools* menu.

You can choose:

- which types of events you want to monitor
- which objects you want to monitor

![](img/event-viewer.png)

In the example illustrated above, the user has chosen to monitor events on a Form `#.f`. Furthermore, the user has chosen to monitor GotFocus, LostFocus, MouseUp, MouseDblClick and Configure events.

Entries in the *Action* column report the action  that was associated with the event at the time it was placed in the queue. This may or may not be the same as the action that is associated with the event when it reaches the top of the event queue and is processed.

## The Spy Menu

The Spy menu, illustrated above, provides the following options and actions.

|Item|Description|
|---|---|
|Clear|Clears all of the event information that is currently displayed in the *Event Viewer* .|
|Copy|Copies the highlighted rows to the clipboard.|
|All|In this mode all the events are displayed in the *Event Viewer* as they occur, whether or not there is an action associated with them.|
|When Placed in Object's Queue|In this mode only events that have associated actions are displayed in the event viewer. Note that KeyPress events are always queued and therefore always appear, even if there is no associated action.|
|Current Queue State|In this mode the *Event Viewer* displays a snapshot of the internal event queue. Only those events that are currently in the internal APL event queue waiting to be processed are displayed.|
|Enable Logging|This item switches event logging on and off.|
