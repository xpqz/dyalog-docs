<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Debugging Threads</span></h1>

The Debugger  provides a tabbed interface that allows you to easily switch between suspended threads for debugging purposes. To keep things simple for non-threaded applications, Tabs are only displayed if there is a thread suspended that is other than Thread 0. The following picture shows the Debugger open on a multi-threaded application (LIFT.DWS) when only Thread 0 is suspended. This has been achieved by setting a stop on `RUN[63]`

In the next picture, the user has chosen to display the *Threads Tool* and then dock it between the Session and Debugger windows. Note that only one thread, thread 0 (`Run`) is suspended. All the other threads are *Paused* (because *Pause on Error* is enabled).

The user then uses the context menu to *Switch To* Thread 14 (whose name is `Lady 14`) which was Paused on `PERSON[7]` in the middle of a `⎕TGET`. The act of switching to this thread caused it to be suspended at the beginning of its current line `PERSON[7]` and the Debugger now displays two Tabs to represent the two suspended threads. Note that both the thread id and the thread name are displayed on the Tabs.

Note also that the Session window is connected to the thread indicated by the selected Tab. In this case, typing `MYFLOOR` into the Session window displays the value of the local variable `MYFLOOR` in Thread 14 (`Lady 14`).

You can use the Tabs to switch between the suspended threads, so clicking the Tab labelled `0:Run` causes the display to change to the picture shown below. The Session is now connected to Thread 0 (`Run`), so the value of `⎕LC` is 63.
