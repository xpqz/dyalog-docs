The Dyalog  Development Environment includes a Session Manager, an Editor, and a Tracer all of which operate in windows on the screen. The session window is created when you start APL and is present until you terminate your APL session. In addition there may be a number of edit and/or trace Windows, which are created and destroyed dynamically as required. All APL windows are under the control of Windows and may be selected, moved, resized, maximised and minimised using the standard facilities that Windows provides.
