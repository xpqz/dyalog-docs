<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Status Window</span></h1>

The Status window is used to display system messages and supplementary information. These include the operations that take place when you register an OLEServer or ActiveXControl.

The Status window is also used to display supplementary information about errors. For example if you attempt to use a .NET method with incorrect argument(s) you will get a suitable error message in the Status window, in addition to the `DOMAIN ERROR` message in the Session.

<h2 class="example">Example</h2>
```apl

      ⎕USING←'System'
      bd←⎕NEW DateTime(2015 4) ⍝ Typo (2015 4 30) 
DOMAIN ERROR
      bd←⎕NEW DateTime(2015 4) ⍝ Typo (2015 4 30)
     ∧
```

The Status window can be explicitly displayed or hidden using the `[Status]` system operation which is associated with the *Tools/Status* menu item. There is also an option to have the Status window appear automatically whenever a new message is written to it. This option is selected using the `[AutoStatus]` system operation which is associated with the *Tools/AutoStatus* menu item.

Note that when you close the Status window, all the system messages in it are cleared.
