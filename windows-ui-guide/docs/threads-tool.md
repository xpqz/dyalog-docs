<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">The Threads Tool</span></h1>

The Threads Tool is used to monitor and debug multi-threaded applications. To display the Threads Tool, select *Show Threads Tool* from the *Session Threads* menu, or *Threads* from the Session pop-up menu.

The above picture illustrates a situation using the `lift.dws` workspace after executing the function `RUN`. The *Pause on Error* option was enabled and a Stop was set on `RUN[63]`. When `RUN` suspended at this point, all other threads (1-8) were automatically Paused. Note that all other threads happen to be Paused in the middle of calls to system functions

The columns of the Threads Tool display the following information.

|Column  |Description                                          |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
|Tid     |The Thread ID ( `⎕TID` ) and name ( `⎕TNAME` ) if set|
|Location|The currently executing line of function code        |
|State   |Indicates what the thread is doing. (see below)      |
|Flags   |Normal or Paused.                                    |
|Treq    |The Thread Requirements ( `⎕TREQ` )                  |

|Session                    |Indicates that Session window is connected to this thread.                            |
|(no stack)                 |Indicates that the thread has no SI stack and the Session is connected to another thread. This state can only occur for Thread 0.|
|Exiting                    |About to be terminated|
|`:Hold`                    |Waiting for a `:Hold` token|

|`⎕TGET` (Ready to continue)|Executing `⎕TGET`, having got a token |
|`⎕TSYNC`                   |Waiting for another thread to terminate |
|Awaiting request           |Indicates a thread that is associated with a .NET system thread, but is currently unused|
|Called .NET                |Waiting for a call to .NET to return.|

## Paused/Normal

In addition to the thread state as described above, a thread may be *Paused* or *Normal* as shown in the *Flags* column. A *Paused* thread is one that has temporarily been removed from the list of threads that are being scheduled by the thread scheduler. A *Paused* thread is effectively frozen.

|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Switch to             |Selecting this item causes APL to attempt to suspend (if necessary) and switch to the selected thread, connecting it to the Session and Debugger windows.|
|Interrupt             |Causes a (STRONG) interrupt in the selected thread the next time it is scheduled, essentially it allows you to target an interrupt at a specific thread. |
|Ignore Interrupts     |Allows you to specify that the selected thread should ignore weak interrupts.                                                                            |
|Refresh Now           |Refreshes the *Threads Tool* display to show the current position and state of each thread.                                                              |
|Auto Refresh          |Selecting this item causes the *Threads Tool* to be updated continuously, so that it shows the latest position and state of each thread.                 |
|Pause Threads on Error|If this item is checked, APL automatically Pauses all other threads when a thread suspends due to an error or an interrupt.                              |
|Paused                |This item toggles a thread between being *Paused* and *Normal* . It Pauses a *Normal* thread and resumes a *Paused* thread.                              |
|Pause All             |This item causes all threads to be *Paused* .                                                                                                            |
|Resume All            |This item resumes all threads.                                                                                                                           |
|Restart All           |This item resumes all *Paused* threads, restarts all suspended threads, and closes the Debugger.                                                         |
