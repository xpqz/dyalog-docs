<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Classic Edition Keyboard</span></h1>

The standard Classic Edition keyboard tables are files supplied in the aplkeys sub-directory named cc.din where cc is the standard 2-character country code, for example, `uk.din`.

Note that the standard tables do not support the entry of APL underscored characters `⍙ⒶⒷⒸⒹⒺⒻⒼⒽⒾⒿⓀⓁⓂⓃⓄⓅⓆⓇⓈⓉⓊⓋⓌⓍⓎⓏ`.

The standard table supports two modes of use; traditional (mode 0) and unified (mode 1). The keyboard starts in mode 1 and may be switched between modes by clicking the *Uni/Apl* field in the status bar or by keying * on the Numeric-Keypad.

The Classic Edition keyboard layout is close to that of the Unicode Edition, but does not include certain symbols which are only provided in the Unicode Edition.
