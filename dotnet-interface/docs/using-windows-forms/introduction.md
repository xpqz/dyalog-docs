`System.Windows.Forms` is a .NET namespace that provides a set of classes for creating the Graphical User Interface for Windows applications.

As an alternative to the built-in Dyalog GUI, Windows Forms has been superseded by Windows Presentation Foundation which is described in the next Chapter. This section is included to support existing Dyalog applications that make use of Windows Forms.

Unless otherwise specified, all the examples described in this Chapter may be found in the `samples\winforms\winforms.dws` workspace.
