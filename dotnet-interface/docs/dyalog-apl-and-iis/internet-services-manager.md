<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Internet Services Manager</span></h1>

As its name suggests, Internet Services Manager is a tool for managing IIS. If you are developing Web Pages and/or Web Services, you will be using this tool a lot, and it makes sense to add it as a shortcut on your desktop.

To do this, open *Control Panel*, then open *Administrative Tools*, right-click *Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager*, and select *Send To Desktop (create shortcut)*.

## The *dyalog.net* Application

Following a successful installation of Dyalog APL, the `dyalog.net` Application should appear in Internet Services Manager as shown below.
