<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Name Scope</span></h1>

APL's name scope rules apply whether a function call is synchronous or asynchronous. For example when a defined function is called, names in the calling environment are visible, unless explicitly shadowed in the function header.

Just as with a synchronous call, a function called asynchronously has its own local environment, but can communicate with its parent and "sibling" functions via local names in the parent.

This point is important. It means that siblings can run in parallel without danger of local name clashes. For example, a GUI application can accommodate multiple concurrent instances of its callback functions.

However, with an asynchronous call, as the calling function continues to execute, both child *and parent functions* may modify values in the calling environment. Both functions see such changes immediately they occur.

If a parent function terminates while any of its children are still running, those children will no longer have access to its local names, and references to such names will either generate `VALUE ERROR` or be replaced by values from the environment that called the parent function. If a child function references variables defined by its parent or relies in any other way on its parent's environment (such as a local value of `⎕IO`), the parent function should therefore execute a `⎕TSYNC` in order to wait for its children to complete before itself exiting.

If, on the other hand, after launching an asynchronous child, the parent function calls a *new* function (either synchronously or asynchronously); names in the new function are beyond the purview of the original child. In other words, a function can only ever see its calling stack decrease in size – never increase. This is in order that the parent may call new defined functions without affecting the environment of its asynchronous children.
