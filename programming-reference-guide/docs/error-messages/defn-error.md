<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">defn error</span></h1>



This report is given when either:

- The system editor is invoked in order to edit a function that does not exist, or the named function is pendent or locked, or the given name is an object other than a function.
- The system editor is invoked to define a new function whose name is already active.
- The header line of a function is replaced or edited in definition mode with a line whose syntax is incompatible with that of a header line.  The original header line is re-displayed by the system editor with the cursor placed at the end of the line.  Back-spacing to the beginning of the line followed by line-feed restores the original header line.
