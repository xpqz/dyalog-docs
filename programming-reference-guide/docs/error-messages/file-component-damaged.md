This report is given if an attempt is made to access a component that is not a valid APL object.  This will rarely occur, but may happen as a result of a previous computer system failure.  Components files may be checked using `⎕FCHK`. See [File Check and Repair ](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/fchk).
