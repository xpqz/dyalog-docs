<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">warning duplicate name</span></h1>



This warning message is reported on closing definition mode when one or more names are duplicated in the header line of the function.  This may be perfectly valid.  Definition of the function in the active workspace is not prevented.  The order in which values are associated with names in the header line is described in ["Defined Functions & Operators"](../defined-functions-and-operators/defined-functions-and-operators.md).
