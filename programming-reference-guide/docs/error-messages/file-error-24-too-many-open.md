This report is given when the task limit on the number of open files is exceeded.  It may occur when an APL session is started or when a shell command is issued to start an external process through the system command `⎕SH`.  It is necessary to reduce the number of open files.  It may be necessary to increase the limit on the number of open files to overcome the problem.
