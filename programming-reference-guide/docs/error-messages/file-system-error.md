This report is given if an input/output (I/O) error occurs when reading from or writing to the host file system. Contact your System Administrator.


If this occurs when the file is being written it may become damaged; it is therefore advisable to check the integrity of the file using `⎕FCHK` once the source of the I/O errors has been corrected. See [File Check and Repair ](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/fchk).
