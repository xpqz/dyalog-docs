This report is given in the following situations:

- When the system command `)SAVE` is used without a name, and the workspace is not named.  In this case the system reports `not` `saved this ws is CLEAR WS`.
- When the system command `)SAVE` is used with a name, and that name is not the current name of the workspace, but is the name of an existing file.


In neither case is the workspace renamed.
