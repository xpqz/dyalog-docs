<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">The Effect of Buffering</span></h1>

Disk drives are fairly slow devices, so most operating systems take advantage of a facility called buffering. This is shown in simple terms below:
```apl
.------------------.
| Operating System |   .--------.    .---------.
| instruction to   |-->| BUFFER |--->| File on |
| write large data |   ---------.    |  disk   |
| object to a file |                 ----------.
-------------------.
```

When you issue a write to a disk area, the data is not necessarily sent straight to the disk. Sometimes it is written to an internal buffer (or cache), which is usually held in (fast) main memory. When the buffer is full, the contents are passed to the disk. This means that at any one time, you could have data in the buffer, as well as on the disk. If your machine goes down whilst in this state, you could have a partially updated file on the disk. In these circumstances, the operating system generally recovers your file automatically.

If this facility is exploited, it offers very fast file updating. For systems that are I/O bound, this is a very important consideration. However, the disadvantage is that whilst it may appear that a write operation has completed successfully, part of the data may still be residing in the buffer, waiting to be flushed out to the disk. It is usually possible to force the buffer to empty; see your operating system manuals for details (UNIX automatically invokes the `sync()` command every few seconds to flush its internal buffers).

Dyalog APL exploits this facility, employing buffers internal to APL as well as making use of the system buffers. Of course, these techniques cannot be used when the file is shared with other users; obviously, the updates must be written immediately to the disk. However, if the file is exclusively tied, then several layers of buffers are employed to ensure that file access is as fast as possible.

You can ensure that the contents of all internal buffers are flushed to disk by issuing `⎕FUNTIE ⍬` at any time.
