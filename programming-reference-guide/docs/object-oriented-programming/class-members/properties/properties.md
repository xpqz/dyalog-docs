<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Properties</span></h1>

A Property behaves in a very similar way to an ordinary APL variable. To obtain the value of a Property, you simply reference its name. To change the value of a Property, you assign a new value to the name.

However, *under the covers*, a Property is accessed via a *PropertyGet* function and its value is changed via a *PropertySet* function. Furthermore, Properties may be defined to allow partial (indexed) retrieval and assignment to occur.

There are three types of Property, namely *Simple*, *Numbered* and *Keyed*.

- A *Simple Property* is one whose value is accessed (by APL) in its entirety and re-assigned (by APL) in its entirety.
- A *Numbered Property* behaves like an array (conceptually a vector) which is only ever *partially* accessed and set (one element at a time) via indices. The Numbered Property is designed to allow APL to perform selections and structural operations on the Property.
- A *Keyed Property* is similar to a Numbered Property except that its elements are accessed via arbitrary keys instead of indices.

The following cases illustrate the difference between Simple and Numbered Properties.

If Instance `MyInst` has a Simple Property `Sprop` and a Numbered Property `Nprop`, the expressions
```apl
      X竊信yInst.SProp
      X竊信yInst.SProp[2]
```

both cause APL to call the PropertyGet function to retrieve the entire value of `Sprop`. The second statement subsequently uses indexing to extract just the second element of the value.

Whereas, the expression:
```apl
      X竊信yInst.NProp[2]
```

causes APL to call the PropertyGet function with an additional argument which specifies that only the second element of the Property is required. Moreover, the expression:
```apl
      X竊信yInst.NProp
```

causes APL to call the PropertyGet function successively, for every element of the Property.

A Property is defined by a `:Property ... :EndProperty` section in a Class Script.

Within the body of a Property Section there may be:

- one or more `:Access` statements which **must appear first** in the body of the Property.
- a single PropertyGet function.
- a single PropertySet function
- a single PropertyShape function
