An Interface is defined by a Script containing skeleton declarations of Properties and/or Methods. The script must begin with a `:Interface Statement` and end with a `:EndInterface Statement`.

An Interface may not contain Fields.

Properties and Methods defined in an Interface, and the Class functions that implement the Interface, **may not** contain :Access Statements.
