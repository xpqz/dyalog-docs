Applies To: [Printer](../objects/printer.md)


**Description**


Specifies whether pages are printed on separate sheets or back-to-back.


Duplex is a character vector which is either empty or contains `'Simplex'`, `'Vertical'`, or `'Horizontal'`.


The default value for Duplex is derived from the current printer setting and `'Vertical'` and `'Horizontal'` are only effective if the printer supports a duplex capability.
