Applies To: [ComboEx](../objects/comboex.md)


**Description**


If set, the edit control portion of the ComboEx will use the forward slash (/), back slash (\), and period (.) characters as word delimiters. This makes keyboard shortcuts for word-by-word cursor movement (Ctrl + arrow keys) effective in path names and URLs.
