**Applies To:** [TCPSocket](../objects/tcpsocket.md)

**Description**

The Encoding property is a character vector that specifies how character data
are encoded or translated.

The possible values are `'None'`,
`'UTF-8'`, `'Classic'`, or `'Unicode'`, depending upon the value of the [Style](style.md) property.

Table: Unicode Edition

|Style   |Encoding   |Description|
|--------|-----------|-----------|
|`'Raw'` |'None' { .shaded } |Not applicable. Only integer data may be transmitted/received.|
|`'Char'`|'None' { .shaded } |Transmission is limited to characters with Unicode code points in the range 0-255. Attempting to transmit (or receive) a character outside this range will cause `DOMAIN ERROR`.|
|_      _|`'UTF-8'`  |Characters are transmitted/received using the UTF-8 encoding scheme.|
|`'APL'` |'Classic' { .shaded } |Characters are transmitted/received as indices of `⎕AV`, and translated according to the current value of `⎕AVU` . An attempt to transmit or receive a characters not present in `⎕AVU` will cause `TRANSLATION ERROR`|
|_      _|`'Unicode'`|Characters are transmitted/received *as is* (as Unicode code points).|

Table: Classic Edition

|Style    |Encoding   |Description|
|---------|-----------|-----------|
|`'Raw'`  |'None' { .shaded } |Not applicable. Only integer data may be transmitted/received.|
|`'Char'` |'None' { .shaded } |Characters (which are represented internally as indices of `⎕AV`) are translated to and from ASCII using the Output Translate Table win.dot.|
|_       _|`'UTF-8'`  |Characters are converted to/from Unicode using `⎕AVU` and transmitted/received using the UTF-8 encoding scheme. An attempt to transmit or receive a characters not present in `⎕AVU` will cause `TRANSLATION ERROR`.|
|`'Raw'`  |'Classic' { .shaded } |Characters are transmitted/received as indices of `⎕AV`.|
|_       _|`'Unicode'`|Characters are converted to/from Unicode using `⎕AVU` and transmitted/received as Unicode code points. An attempt to transmit or receive a characters not present in `⎕AVU` will cause `TRANSLATION ERROR`.|

The default value of Encoding depends upon the value of [Style](style.md) as indicated. Default values are highlighted <span class="shaded">thus</span> in the above tables.

An attempt to set the value of Encoding to a value not valid for the current [Style](style.md),
as implied by the above tables, will cause `DOMAIN ERROR`.

If you change the value of the [Style](style.md) property, the value of Encoding will remain unchanged if it is valid for the new
Style. Otherwise it will revert to the default value for the new value of [Style](style.md).
