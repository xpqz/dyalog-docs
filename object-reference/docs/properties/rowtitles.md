<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">RowTitles</span> <span class="right">Property</span></h1>



**Applies To:** [Grid](../objects/grid.md)

**Description**


This property specifies the headings that are displayed to the left of the rows in a [Grid](../objects/grid.md) object. If specified, it must be a vector of character vectors or matrices whose length is the same as the number of rows implied by the [Values](values.md) property. The default value of RowTitles is an empty character vector. In this case, the system displays the row numbers.


To disable the display of row titles in a [Grid](../objects/grid.md), you should set the [TitleWidth](titlewidth.md) property to 0.
