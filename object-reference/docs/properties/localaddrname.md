**Applies To:** [TCPSocket](../objects/tcpsocket.md)

**Description**


The LocalAddrName property is a character vector that specifies the host name of your computer. It may be useful when you have more than one network adapter (perhaps an Ethernet adapter and a token ring adapter) and you wish to avoid hard-coding the IP address.


Note that you may use *either* [LocalAddr](localaddr.md) *or* LocalAddrName to identify the local computer. If you specify both properties, the value of LocalAddrName will be ignored.


LocalAddrName may only be specified by a server [TCPSocket](../objects/tcpsocket.md). Furthermore, it must be specified in the `⎕WC` statement that creates the [TCPSocket](../objects/tcpsocket.md) object and it may not subsequently be changed using `⎕WS`.


When the specified host name has been resolved to an IP address, the [TCPSocket](../objects/tcpsocket.md) will generate a [TCPGotAddr](../methodorevents/tcpgotaddr.md) event and update the value of [LocalAddr](localaddr.md) accordingly.


For a client [TCPSocket](../objects/tcpsocket.md), you may not specify LocalAddrName and `⎕WG` returns an empty character vector.
