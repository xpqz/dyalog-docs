**Applies To:** [Form](../objects/form.md), [HTMLRenderer](../objects/htmlrenderer.md), [SubForm](../objects/subform.md)

**Description**


This property determines whether or not a [Form](../objects/form.md) or [SubForm](../objects/subform.md) has a "System Menu " box in the top-left corner of its border. Pressing the left mouse button in this box brings up the standard window control menu for the [Form](../objects/form.md). Double clicking the box closes the [Form](../objects/form.md).


SysMenu is a single number with the value 0 (no System menu box) or 1 (System Menu box is provided). The default is 1.


If any of the SysMenu, [MaxButton](maxbutton.md), [MinButton](minbutton.md) and [Moveable](moveable.md) properties are set to 1, the [Form](../objects/form.md) or [SubForm](../objects/subform.md) has a title bar.
