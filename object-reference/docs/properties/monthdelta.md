**Applies To:** [Calendar](../objects/calendar.md), [DateTimePicker](../objects/datetimepicker.md)

**Description**


The MonthDelta property specifies the number of months by which a [Calendar](../objects/calendar.md) object scrolls when the user clicks its scroll buttons.


MonthDelta is an integer or an empty vector (zilde). The latter means that the [Calendar](../objects/calendar.md) object scrolls by the number of months that are currently displayed in its window. This is the default.
