**Applies To:** [ComboEx](../objects/comboex.md), [TreeView](../objects/treeview.md)

**Description**


The SelImageIndex property determines which bitmapped images in an [ImageList](../objects/imagelist.md) correspond to items in a [TreeView](../objects/treeview.md) object when the item is *selected*. It is an integer vector whose length is the same as the number of items in the object and is `⎕IO` dependent.
