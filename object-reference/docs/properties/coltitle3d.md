<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">ColTitle3D</span> <span class="right">Property</span></h1>



**Applies To:** [ListView](../objects/listview.md)

**Description**


The ColTitle3D property is a Boolean value that specifies whether or not the column titles in a [ListView](../objects/listview.md) object are displayed with a 3-dimensional effect. Its default value is 1. A column heading with a 3-dimensional button appearance may be used to imply that the user may click on it to sort by the values in that column.


ColTitle3D is only relevant if [View](view.md) is `'Report'` and [Header](header.md) is 1. Note that this property may only be set by `⎕WC` and may not subsequently be changed using `⎕WS`.
