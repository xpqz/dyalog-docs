**Applies To:** [RichEdit](../objects/richedit.md)

**Description**


The WordFormat property is identical to the [CharFormat](charformat.md) property except that it is used to apply formatting to the selected word or words in a [RichEdit](../objects/richedit.md) object. If the selection is empty but the insertion point is inside a word, the formatting is applied to the word. See [CharFormat](charformat.md) for further details.
