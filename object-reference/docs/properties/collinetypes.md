**Applies To:** [Grid](../objects/grid.md)

**Description**


This property specifies the appearance of the vertical grid lines in a [Grid](../objects/grid.md) object.



ColLineTypes is an integer vector, whose length is normally equal to the number of columns in the [Grid](../objects/grid.md). Each element in ColLineTypes specifies an index into the [GridLineFCol](gridlinefcol.md) and [GridLineWidth](gridlinewidth.md) properties, thus selecting the colour and width of the vertical grid lines.


For example, if ColLineTypes[1] is 3, the first vertical grid line in the [Grid](../objects/grid.md) is displayed using the colour specified by the 3rd element of [GridLineFCol](gridlinefcol.md), and the width specified by the 3<sup>rd</sup> element of [GridLineWidth](gridlinewidth.md).


Note that ColLineTypes is not `⎕IO` dependent, and the value 0 is treated the same as the value 1; both selecting the *first* colour and line width specified by [GridLineFCol](gridlinefcol.md) and [GridLineWidth](gridlinewidth.md) respectively.


The default value of ColLineTypes is an empty numeric vector (`⍬`). If so, all vertical grid lines are drawn using the first element of [GridLineFCol](gridlinefcol.md) and [GridLineWidth](gridlinewidth.md).


A vertical grid line is drawn down the right edge of its associated column. One pixel is drawn *inside* the column of cells; additional pixels (if any) are drawn *between* that column of cells and the next one to its right.
