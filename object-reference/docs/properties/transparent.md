<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Transparent</span> <span class="right">Property</span></h1>



**Applies To:** [Animation](../objects/animation.md), [ButtonEdit](../objects/buttonedit.md), [ToolControl](../objects/toolcontrol.md)

**Description**


The Transparent property specifies whether or not a [ToolControl](../objects/toolcontrol.md) is transparent.


Transparent is a single number with the value 0 (the default) or 1.


If Transparent is 1, the visual effect is as if the [ToolButtons](../objects/toolbutton.md) (and other controls owned by the [ToolControl](../objects/toolcontrol.md)) were drawn directly on the parent Form as illustrated below.
