**Applies To:** [ProgressBar](../objects/progressbar.md)

**Description**


The ProgressStyle property specifies the appearance of a [ProgressBar](../objects/progressbar.md) control.


ProgressStyle is a character vector that may be `'Normal'`, `'Smooth'` or `'Marquee'`. Its value is effective only when the object is created with `⎕WC`. Changing ProgressStyle with `⎕WS` has no effect on the appearance or behaviour of the [ProgressBar](../objects/progressbar.md).



If ProgressStyle is `'Normal'`, the highlight in the centre of the [ProgressBar](../objects/progressbar.md) is displayed as a broken bar. This is the default.


If ProgressStyle is `'Smooth'`, the highlight in the centre of the [ProgressBar](../objects/progressbar.md) is displayed as a solid block of colour. This style only applies if *Windows Classic Theme* is in use. If not, it will be as if  `'Normal'` were specified.


If ProgressStyle is `'Marquee'`,  the highlight in the centre of the [ProgressBar](../objects/progressbar.md) is displayed as a broken bar that moves continuously from left to right. The speed is controlled by the [Interval](interval.md) Property which determines the frequency in milliseconds with which the highlight is redrawn, each time further along the [ProgressBar](../objects/progressbar.md). The special value of `¯1` causes the animation to stop.


**Note that this feature only applies if Native Look and Feel 

 is enabled.**
 If not,  `'Marquee'` will produce the same behaviour as `'Normal'`.


The pictures below illustrate the appearance of the different values of ProgressStyle.
