**Applies To:** [TCPSocket](../objects/tcpsocket.md)

**Description**


The LocalPort property is a scalar integer in the range 1-65536 that
identifies the [port number](../miscellaneous/port-number.md) associated with a [TCPSocket](../objects/tcpsocket.md)
 object.



Note that you may use *either* LocalPort *or* [LocalPortName](localportname.md)
 to identify the service. The use of [LocalPortName](localportname.md)
 is slightly slower but it avoids hard-coding the port number in your program and
is generally more flexible. If you specify both properties, the value of [LocalPortName](localportname.md)
 will be ignored.


LocalPort may be specified only by the process that is initiating the
connection (the server) and must be set by the `⎕WC`
statement that creates the [TCPSocket](../objects/tcpsocket.md).
LocalPort may not subsequently be changed using `⎕WS`



If you specify a value of 0, the system will assign an available port number.
For example:
```apl
      'S1' ⎕wc'TCPSocket' ('LocalPort' 0)
      S1.LocalPort
4047
```



For a process that is completing a connection, LocalPort is allocated by the
system and is effectively read-only.
