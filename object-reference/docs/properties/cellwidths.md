**Description**


This property specifies the width of each column in a [Grid](../objects/grid.md) object in the units specified by its [Coord](coord.md) property. It may be a scalar or a vector whose length is the same as the number of columns implied by the [Values](values.md) property. If it is a scalar, it specifies a constant column width. If it is a vector it specifies the width of each column individually.
