**Applies To:** [Printer](../objects/printer.md)

**Description**


The Resolution property determines the print resolution.


You may set Resolution to `'Draft'`, `'Low'`, `'Medium'` or `'High'`.


Alternatively, you can set Resolution to a 2-element integer vector that specifies the desired number of dots per inch in the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) direction respectively.


The initial value reported by Resolution may be reported in either form (character vector or 2-element numeric vector) according to the current printer settings.
