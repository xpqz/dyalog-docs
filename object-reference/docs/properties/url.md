<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">URL</span> <span class="right">Property</span></h1>



**Applies To:** [HTMLRenderer](../objects/htmlrenderer.md)

**Description**


The URL property is a character vector that  specifies the url of a resource to be requested by the [HTMLRenderer](../objects/htmlrenderer.md). Its default value is an empty character vector.


Specifying URL is an alternative way to setting the [HTML](html.md) property in order to display content in the [HTMLRenderer](../objects/htmlrenderer.md).


When you set the URL property, the [HTMLRenderer](../objects/htmlrenderer.md) will request the corresponding resource (from either the internet or the workspace via an [HTTPRequest](../methodorevents/httprequest.md) event) and the display will change according to the response. The [HTML](html.md) property is ignored and remains unchanged.


When you set the [HTML](html.md) property, the content of the [HTMLRenderer](../objects/htmlrenderer.md) will change accordingly. The current value of the URL property is ignored and remains unchanged.


If you set BOTH URL and [HTML](html.md) in the same statement, the value of URL takes precedence and the assignment to [HTML](html.md) is ignored (it remains unchanged).
