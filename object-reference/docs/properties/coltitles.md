<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">ColTitles</span> <span class="right">Property</span></h1>



**Applies To:** [Grid](../objects/grid.md), [ListView](../objects/listview.md)

**Description**


This property specifies the headings that are displayed above the columns in a [Grid](../objects/grid.md) object. If specified, it must be a vector of character vectors or matrices whose length is the same as the number of columns implied by the [Values](values.md) property. The default value of ColTitles is an empty character vector. In this case, the system displays "standard" spreadsheet column titles A-Z, AA-AZ, BA-BZ and so forth.


To disable the display of column titles in a [Grid](../objects/grid.md), you should set the [TitleHeight](titleheight.md) property to 0.
