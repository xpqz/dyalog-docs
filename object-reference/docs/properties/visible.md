[**Applies To**](../propertyapplies/visible.md)

**Description**


This property specifies whether or not an object is currently visible. It is a single number with the value 0 (object is invisible) or 1 (object is visible). The default is 1. Setting Visible on and off is a way to pop a dialog box up and down as required.


Note that an invisible object is not necessarily inactive, and is capable of generating events. For example, a [Button](../objects/button.md) with a [Cancel](cancel.md) property of 1 will generate a [Select](../methodorevents/select.md) (30) event (if enabled) whether or not it is visible. An invisible object will also respond to methods and  events sent to it by [`⎕NQ`](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/nq).
