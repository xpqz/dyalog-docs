**Applies To:** [Circle](../objects/circle.md), [Ellipse](../objects/ellipse.md), [Poly](../objects/poly.md), [Rect](../objects/rect.md)

**Description**


This property determines how a graphics object is filled. It takes one of the following values, or, if the object has more than one component, a vector of such values.


|FStyle|Effect                                                                                             |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`¯1`  |hollow (no fill). This is the default.                                                             |
|`0`   |solid fill                                                                                         |
|`1`   |hatch fill with horizontal lines                                                                   |
|`2`   |hatch fill with vertical lines                                                                     |
|`3`   |hatch fill with diagonal lines at 135 degrees                                                      |
|`4`   |hatch fill with diagonal lines at 45 degrees                                                       |
|`5`   |hatch fill with horizontal and vertical lines                                                      |
|`6`   |hatch fill with criss-crossing diagonal lines                                                      |
|`str` |the name of. or a ref to, a [Bitmap](../objects/bitmap.md) object which is used to fill the object.|


For example, to fill an object with criss-crossing diagonal lines you would specify `('FStyle' 6)`. If the object contained two components, you could fill the first one with criss-crossing diagonal lines, and the second one with a [Bitmap](../objects/bitmap.md) called `'YES'`, with the specification `('FStyle' 6 'YES')`


If the size of the [Bitmap](../objects/bitmap.md) is 8x8 APL uses a Windows "brush" to fill the object. If not, it uses "tiling". Filling with a brush is faster.
