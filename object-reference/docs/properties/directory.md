**Description**


The Directory property contains a simple character vector which specifies the initial directory from which a list of suitable files is displayed.


If, whilst interacting with the [FileBox](../objects/filebox.md), the user changes directory and exits by pressing "OK" or by closing the [FileBox](../objects/filebox.md), the value of the Directory property is updated accordingly.
