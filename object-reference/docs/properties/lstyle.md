**Applies To:** [Circle](../objects/circle.md), [Ellipse](../objects/ellipse.md), [Locator](../objects/locator.md), [Poly](../objects/poly.md), [Rect](../objects/rect.md)

**Description**


This property determines the type of line used to draw a graphics object. It takes one of the following integer values, or, if the object contains more than one component, a vector of such values.


|---|---------------------|
|0  |solid line           |
|1  |dashed line          |
|2  |dotted line          |
|3  |dash dotted line     |
|4  |dash dot dotted line |
|5  |null line (invisible)|


If LStyle is in the range 1-4, the gaps between the dashes and dots are drawn using the colour specified by [BCol](bcol.md), or are left undrawn (that is, transparent) if [BCol](bcol.md) is not defined.


In versions of Dyalog prior to v13.2 revision 19489, if LWidth specified a line width greater than 1 pixel, a solid line was drawn in the colour specified by the FCol Property, regardless of the value of [LStyle](lstyle.md). From that revision onwards, if the value of LWidth is greater than 1  then the value of LStyle is honoured, but only the FCol of the line is honoured - the BCol is still ignored.
