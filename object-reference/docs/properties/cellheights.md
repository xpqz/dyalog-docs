**Applies To:** [Grid](../objects/grid.md)

**Description**


This property specifies the height of each row in a [Grid](../objects/grid.md) object in the units specified by its [Coord](coord.md) property. It may be a scalar or a vector whose length is the same as the number of rows implied by the [Values](values.md) property. If it is a scalar, it specifies a constant row height. If it is a vector it specifies the height of each row individually.
