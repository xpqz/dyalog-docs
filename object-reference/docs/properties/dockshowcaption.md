**Applies To:** [Form](../objects/form.md), [SubForm](../objects/subform.md)

**Description**


The DockShowCaption property specifies whether or not a Form displays a title bar when it is docked as a SubForm.



DockShowCaption is a single number with the value 0 or 1 (the default).


The DockShowCaption property may be toggled on and off by the user from the object's context menu.



The first picture below illustrates a Form, docked as a SubForm, whose DockShowCaption property is 1, but is about to be set to 0.
