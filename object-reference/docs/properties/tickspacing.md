**Applies To:** [TrackBar](../objects/trackbar.md)

**Description**


The TickSpacing property specifies the spacing between each tick mark in a [TrackBar](../objects/trackbar.md) object. It is an integer between 1 and the maximum value of the [TrackBar](../objects/trackbar.md) which is defined by the 2nd element of the [Limits](limits.md) property.


For example, if you set `('Limits' 10 50)` and you specify `('TickSpacing' 10)` you will obtain 5 ticks corresponding to the values 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 along the slider bar.
