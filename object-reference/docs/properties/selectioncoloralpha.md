**Description**


The SelectionColorAlpha property is a 2-element integer vector that specifies the degree of transparency or shade of the colour that is used to highlight the currently selected block of cells in a [Grid](../objects/grid.md). See [SelectionColor](selectioncolor.md).


The first element refers to the shade to be used  when the Grid has the input focus; the second to when it doesn't. Each element is an integer in the range 0 (invisibly light) to 255 (fully dark).
