**Applies To:** [ButtonEdit](../objects/buttonedit.md), [Edit](../objects/edit.md), [Spinner](../objects/spinner.md)

**Description**


This property specifies the character that is echoed when a user enters data into a single-line [Edit](../objects/edit.md) object ( [Style](style.md) `'Single'`). It does not apply to a multi-line object ([Style](style.md) `'Multi'`). If Password is empty (the default) the character echoed is the same as the character the user entered. If Password is set to (say) the asterisk character (*), the object will display asterisks as the user types into it.
