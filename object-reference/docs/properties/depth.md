<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Depth</span> <span class="right">Property</span></h1>



**Applies To:** [TreeView](../objects/treeview.md)

**Description**


The Depth property specifies the structure of the items in a [TreeView](../objects/treeview.md) object. It is either a scalar 0 or an integer vector of the same length as the Items property.



A value of 0 indicates that the corresponding item is a top-level item. A value of 1 indicates that the corresponding item is a child of the most recent item whose Depth is 0; a value of 2 indicates that the corresponding item is a child of the most recent item whose Depth is 1, and so forth.



For example:
