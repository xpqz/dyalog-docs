**Description**


The Hint property is a character vector that specifies a *help* message that is to be displayed when the user positions the mouse pointer over the object. The Hint is displayed in the object specified by its [HintObj](hintobj.md) property. A [StatusField](../objects/statusfield.md) is often used for this purpose.
