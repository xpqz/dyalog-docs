**Applies To:** [TabControl](../objects/tabcontrol.md)

**Description**


The HotTrack property specifies whether or not the tabs or buttons in a [TabControl](../objects/tabcontrol.md) object ( which are represented by [TabButton](../objects/tabbutton.md) objects), are automatically highlighted by the mouse pointer.


HotTrack is a single number with the value 0 (no highlighting) or 1. The default is 0.


If HotTrack is 1 and the Style property of the [TabControl](../objects/tabcontrol.md) is `'Tabs'` or `'Buttons'`, the text defined by the Caption property of the [TabButton](../objects/tabbutton.md) is highlighted when the mouse pointer is placed over the tab or button. If Style is `'FlatButtons'`, the button is highlighted by being *raised*.


The value of HotTrack is effective only when the object is created with `⎕WC`.
