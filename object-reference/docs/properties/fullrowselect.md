**Applies To:** [ListView](../objects/listview.md), [TreeView](../objects/treeview.md)

**Description**


The FullRowSelect property specifies whether or not the entire row is highlighted when an item in a [ListView](../objects/listview.md) or a [TreeView](../objects/treeview.md) is selected.


FullRowSelect is a single number with the value 0 (only the item name is highlighted) or 1 (the whole row is highlighted); the default is 0.


For a [ListView](../objects/listview.md), FullRowSelect only applies if its [View](view.md) property is set to `'Report'`.


The picture below illustrates the effect on the appearance of a [ListView](../objects/listview.md) object, of setting FullRowSelect to 1.
