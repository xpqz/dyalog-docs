**Applies To:** [Grid](../objects/grid.md)

**Description**


This property defines the keystroke used to switch from Scroll mode to InCell mode in a [Grid](../objects/grid.md). It applies only where the [Grid](../objects/grid.md) has a *floating*[Edit](../objects/edit.md) control. See the description of the [InputMode](inputmode.md) property for further details.


The InputModeKey property is specified (in the same way as the [Accelerator](accelerator.md) property) as a 2-element vector of integer values containing the key number and shift state respectively. Its default is (113 0) which is "F2".


As an example, if you wanted to use Ctrl+Shift+a to switch modes, you would set InputModeKey to (65 3). 65 is the keynumber for "a" and 3 means Shift (1) + Ctrl (2).
