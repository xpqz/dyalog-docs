**Applies To:** [List](../objects/list.md)

**Description**


The SortItems property specifies whether or not the items in a [List](../objects/list.md) object are sorted.


It is Boolean with a default value of 0. If SortItems is 1, the items are automatically sorted in alphabetical order and the object provides word recognition capabilities for selecting an item from the keyboard.


Note that the value of the [Items](items.md) property reflects the order of the items displayed in the [List](../objects/list.md) object rather than the order in the array that was used to assign it.


This property may only be initialised when the object is created and cannot subsequently be changed.
