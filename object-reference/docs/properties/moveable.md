**Applies To:** [Form](../objects/form.md), [HTMLRenderer](../objects/htmlrenderer.md), [SubForm](../objects/subform.md)

**Description**


This property determines whether or not an object can be moved by the user. It is a single number with the value 0 (object cannot be moved) or 1 (object is moveable). If any of the properties [MinButton](minbutton.md), [MaxButton](maxbutton.md), [SysMenu](sysmenu.md), and Moveable are set to 1, the object will have a title bar. However, an object with a title bar is not necessarily moveable.
