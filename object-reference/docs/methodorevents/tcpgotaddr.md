**Applies To:** [TCPSocket](../objects/tcpsocket.md)

**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when a host name (specified by the [RemoteAddrName](../properties/remoteaddrname.md) or [LocalAddrName](../properties/localaddrname.md) property) is resolved to an IP address.


You may not disable or nullify the operation by setting the action code for the event to `¯1` or by returning 0 from a callback function. You may also not call TCPGotAddr as a method or generate this event artificially using `⎕NQ`.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 2-element vector as follows :


|-----|------|-----------------------|
|`[1]`|Object|ref or character vector|
|`[2]`|Event |`'TCPGotAddr'` or 377  |


Note that the IP address is not reported in the event message but may be obtained from [RemoteAddr](../properties/remoteaddr.md) or [LocalAddr](../properties/localaddr.md) as appropriate.
