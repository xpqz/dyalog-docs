<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">GridCopyError</span> <span class="right">Event 196</span></h1>



**Applies To:** [Grid](../objects/grid.md)

**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when the user presses Ctrl+Insert and there is more than one block of selected cells in the [Grid](../objects/grid.md) and the blocks are non-conformable. The default action of the event is to generate a Beep. Setting the action code of this event to `¯1`, or returning a 0 from a callback function attached to it, disables the Beep.


The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/dq), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 5-element vector as follows:


|-----|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|`[5]`|Start |A 2-column integer matrix whose rows identify the address of the first cell (row, column) of each of the selected blocks of cells.|
|`[6]`|End   |A 2-column integer matrix whose rows identify the address of the last cell (row, column) of each of the selected blocks of cells. |


Note that the values of Start and End are sensitive to the index origin, `⎕IO`.
