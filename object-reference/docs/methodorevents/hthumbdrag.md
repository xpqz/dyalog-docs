<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">HThumbDrag</span> <span class="right">Event 442</span></h1>



**Applies To:** [Form](../objects/form.md), [SubForm](../objects/subform.md)

**Description**


If enabled, this event is generated when the user attempts to drag the thumb in a horizontal scrollbar in a [Form](../objects/form.md) or [SubForm](../objects/subform.md). This event occurs only in a [Form](../objects/form.md) or [SubForm](../objects/subform.md) whose [HScroll](../properties/hscroll.md) property is set to `¯1` and is distinct from the Scroll event that is generated by a [Scroll](../objects/scroll.md) object.


The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/dq), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 3-element vector as follows:


|-----|--------|-----------------------|
|`[1]`|Object  |ref or character vector|
|`[2]`|Event   |`'HThumbDrag'` or 442  |
|`[3]`|Position|numeric                |


The value of Position is the new (requested) position of the Thumb. Setting the action code of this event to `¯1`, or returning a 0 from a callback function attached to it, has no effect.
