**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when the user drops one object (the *dragged object*) onto another (the *target object*). The event is generated by the target object, that is, the object which is being dropped **on**.


The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/dq), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 7-element vector as follows :


|-----|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`[1]`|Target Object |ref or character vector                                                                                                           |
|`[2]`|Event         |`'DragDrop'` or 11                                                                                                                |
|`[3]`|Dragged Object|ref or character vector                                                                                                           |
|`[4]`|Y             |y-position of mouse pointer in the target object                                                                                  |
|`[5]`|X             |x-position of mouse pointer in the target object                                                                                  |
|`[6]`|H             |height of dragged object in the coordinate system of the target object                                                            |
|`[7]`|W             |width of dragged object in the coordinate system of the target object                                                             |
|`[8]`|Shift State   |numeric scalar containing the sum of the values associated with the Shift(1), Ctrl(2) and Alt(4) keys when the object was dropped.|


Note that Y, H, X and W are all reported relative to the target object.
