**Applies To:** [Root](../objects/root.md)

**Description**


This method is used to display or remove a bitmap, typically during
initialisation of a Dyalog runtime application.


The argument to GreetBitmap is `⍬` or a
2 element vector as follows:


|-----|----------------|-----------------|
|`[1]`|Display         |0 = off, 1 = on. |
|`[2]`|Bitmap file name|Character vector.|


If the argument is `⍬`, the bitmap is
removed.


The image can also be displayed initially by setting parameter: **greet_bitmap** on the command line. For example:
```apl
c:\myapp\dyalogrt greet_bitmap=mylogo myws
```


The image is displayed until either an untrapped error occurs, causing the
interpreter to (attempt to) display the session window, or the GreetBitmap
method is called.
