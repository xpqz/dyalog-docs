**Applies To:** [Scroll](../objects/scroll.md), [TrackBar](../objects/trackbar.md)

**Description**


If enabled, this event is generated when the user attempts to move the thumb in a scrollbar. This can be done in one of three ways:

1. dragging the thumb.
2. clicking in one of the "arrow" buttons situated at the ends of the scrollbar. This is termed a small change, the size of which is defined by [Step](../properties/step.md)[1].
3. clicking in the body of the scrollbar. This is termed a large change, the size of which is defined by [Step](../properties/step.md)[2].


The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/dq), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 4-element vector as follows :


|-----|-----------|-----------------------|
|`[1]`|Object     |ref or character vector|
|`[2]`|Event      |`'Scroll'` or 37       |
|`[3]`|Scroll Type|numeric                |
|`[4]`|Position   |numeric                |


The value of Scroll Type is 0 (drag), 1 or `¯1` (small change) or 2 or `¯2` (large change). The sign indicates the direction.


The value of Position is the new (requested) position of the thumb. Notice however, that the event is generated **before** the thumb is actually moved. If your callback function returns a scalar 0, the position of the thumb will remain unaltered.
