**Applies To:** [Grid](../objects/grid.md)

**Description**


This method is used to duplicate a column in a [Grid](../objects/grid.md) object.


The argument to DuplicateColumn is a 2, 3, 4 or 5-element vector as follows:


|-----|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|`[1]`|Source Column number|number of the column (integer) to be duplicated|
|`[2]`|Target Column number|new column number (integer)                    |
|`[3]`|Comment flag        |0 or 1 (optional, default 1)                   |
|`[4]`|Lock flag           |0 or 1 (optional, default 1)                   |
|`[5]`|Undo flag           |0 or 1 (optional; default 0)                   |


If the *Comment flag* is 1 (the default), any Comments associated with cells in the source column are duplicated in the target column.


If the *Lock flag* is 1 (the default), the lock state of the column is duplicated; otherwise, the new column is not locked.


If the *Undo flag* is 1, the column may subsequently be restored by invoking the Undo method. If this element is omitted or is 0, the operation may not be undone.
