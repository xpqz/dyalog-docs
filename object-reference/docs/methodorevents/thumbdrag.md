**Applies To:** [Scroll](../objects/scroll.md), [TrackBar](../objects/trackbar.md)

**Description**


If enabled, this event is generated when the user drags the thumb in a [TrackBar](../objects/trackbar.md) object. The event is reported *after* the value of the Thumb property has been updated and is reported continuously as the thumb is dragged. You may not disable this event or alter its effect with a callback function.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 3-element vector as follows :

|`[2]`|Event      |`'ThumbDrag'` or 440                                                                    |
