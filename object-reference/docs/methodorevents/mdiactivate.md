**Applies To:** [SubForm](../objects/subform.md)

**Description**


This event is generated when the user activates a particular [SubForm](../objects/subform.md) that is the child of an [MDIClient](../objects/mdiclient.md). This occurs when the user clicks the left mouse button in the [SubForm](../objects/subform.md) or selects it from the menu nominated for this purpose (see [MDIMenu](../properties/mdimenu.md) property). You may also call MDIActivate as a method.


Note that this event is reported after the action has taken place and cannot be disabled by returning 0 from a callback function or by setting its action code to `¯1`.


The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/dq), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 3-element vector as follows :


|-----|-----------|-----------------------|
|`[1]`|Object     |ref or character vector|
|`[2]`|Event      |`'MDIActivate'` or 42  |
|`[3]`|Object name|character vector       |


Note that the 3rd element of the event message is either an empty vector or contains the name of the [SubForm](../objects/subform.md) that was previously the active one in the same [MDIClient](../objects/mdiclient.md).
