<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">GridKeyPress</span> <span class="right">Event 24</span></h1>



**Applies To:** [Grid](../objects/grid.md)

**Description**


If enabled, this event is generated when the user presses and releases a key in a [Grid](../objects/grid.md) cell.


The GridKeyPress is reported on the [Grid](../objects/grid.md), *after* the [KeyPress](keypress.md) event, which is reported on the [Input](../properties/input.md) object associated with the current cell.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 6-element vector as follows :


|-----|------------|--------------------------|
|`[1]`|Object      |ref or character vector   |
|`[2]`|Event       |`'GridKeyPress'` or 24    |
|`[3]`|Input Code  |character scalar or vector|
|`[4]`|ASCII code  |integer scalar            |
|`[5]`|Key Number  |integer scalar            |
|`[6]`|Shift State |integer scalar            |
|`[7]`|Input Object|ref or character vector   |


For a full description of elements [3-6], see [KeyPress](./keypress.md) event.


The 7<sup>th</sup> element of the event message contains either a reference to, or the name of the Input object associated with the current cell and on which the corresponding [KeyPress](./keypress.md) event has been reported.


The default action of the GridKeyPress event is to pass a [KeyPress](keypress.md) event message back to the appropriate Input object to be actioned. The GridKeyPress is reported on the Grid, after the [KeyPress](keypress.md) event on the Input object. If a callback on the Input object's [KeyPress](keypress.md) event returns 0 or if a callback on GridKeyPress returns 0, the keystroke will be ignored.
