<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Setup</span> <span class="right">Method 101</span></h1>



**Applies To:** [Printer](../objects/printer.md)

**Description**


This method causes the system to display a standard [Printer](../objects/printer.md) Setup dialog box and thereby allows the user to alter the printer settings. This is a "modal" dialog box that must be closed before the APL application can continue.


The Setup method is niladic.


If you attach a callback function to this event and have it return a value of 0, the dialog box will not appear.
