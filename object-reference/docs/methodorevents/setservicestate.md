**Applies To:** [Root](../objects/root.md)

**Description**


This method is used to set the state of a Dyalog APL service running under Windows. See [APL Application as a Service](../../../windows-installation-and-configuration-guide/apl-application-as-a-service).


The argument to the SetServiceState method is the desired state of the service. This should be one of the following numeric values:


|---------------|---|
|SERVICE_STOPPED|1  |
|SERVICE_RUNNING|4  |
|SERVICE_PAUSED |7  |


The state of a Windows service is determined by the user and the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM).


When the SCM requests a change of state, the APL interpreter responds by setting its state to the corresponding *pending* level (SERVICE_STOPPED_PENDING, SERVICE_RUNNING_PENDING or SERVICE_PAUSED_PENDING) and then generates a [ServiceNotification](./servicenotification.md) event.


It is the responsibility of the APL service to process this event, perform the appropriate application tasks, and then respond (to the SCM) by calling the [SetServiceState](./setservicestate.md) method to confirm that the service has reached the desired state.
