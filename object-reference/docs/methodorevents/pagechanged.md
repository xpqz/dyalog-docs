<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">PageChanged</span> <span class="right">Event 356</span></h1>



**Applies To:** [PropertyPage](../objects/propertypage.md)

**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when the [Changed](../properties/changed.md) property of a [PropertyPage](../objects/propertypage.md) is altered by user action. It is *not* reported if you reset the [Changed](../properties/changed.md) property using `⎕WS`.


The [Changed](../properties/changed.md) property is reset by two separate user actions. It is set to 1 when the user alters any of the controls on the [PropertyPage](../objects/propertypage.md). It is reset to 0 when the user clicks the Apply button, although this action may be disabled by a callback function on the [PageApply](./pageapply.md) event.


The PageChanged event is reported for information only and may not itself be disabled or affected by a callback function.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 3-element vector as follows :


|-----|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`[1]`|Object       |ref or character vector                                                 |
|`[2]`|Event        |`'PageChanged'` or 356                                                  |
|`[3]`|Changed value|New value for the [Changed](../properties/changed.md) property (0 or 1).|
