**Applies To:** [Form](../objects/form.md), [SubForm](../objects/subform.md)

**Description**

This event is generated by a [Form](../objects/form.md) or [SubForm](../objects/subform.md) when the user attempts to change the [State](../properties/state.md) of a [Form](../objects/form.md), by minimising it, maximising it, or restoring it from a minimised or maximised state. The event is reported **before** the window changes state. You may prevent the state change by disabling the event (action code `¯1`) or by returning a 0 result from an attached callback function.

The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/dq), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 3-element vector as follows:

|-----|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`[1]`|Object      |ref or character vector                                                             |
|`[2]`|Event       |`'StateChange'` or 35                                                               |
|`[3]`|Window state|0 (about to be restored)<br/>1 (about to be minimised)<br/>2 (about to be maximised)|
