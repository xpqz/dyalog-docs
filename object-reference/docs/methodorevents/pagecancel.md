<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">PageCancel</span> <span class="right">Event 351</span></h1>



**Applies To:** [PropertyPage](../objects/propertypage.md)

**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when the user presses the Cancel button in a [PropertySheet](../objects/propertysheet.md) object and is reported by the current [PropertyPage](../objects/propertypage.md). This event is reported for information only and may not be disabled by a callback function. However, the operation will also generate a Close event reported by the [PropertySheet](../objects/propertysheet.md) itself that may be disabled by a callback.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 2-element vector as follows :


|-----|------|-----------------------|
|`[1]`|Object|ref or character vector|
|`[2]`|Event |`'PageCancel'` or 351  |
