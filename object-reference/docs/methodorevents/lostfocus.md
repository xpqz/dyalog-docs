**Description**


If enabled, this event is generated when the user transfers the keyboard focus away from the object in question.


The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/dq), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 3-element vector as follows :


|-----|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|`[1]`|Object     |ref or character vector                                      |
|`[2]`|Event      |`'LostFocus'` or 41                                          |
|`[3]`|Object name|character vector (name of object that has received the focus)|


If the focus is transferred to a window that is not part of the Dyalog APL GUI Interface, the third element is an empty vector.


The LostFocus event is generated **after** the focus has changed. The default processing is therefore to take no action. However, if you inhibit the event by returning a 0 from your callback function, the focus is automatically restored to the object that had lost it.
