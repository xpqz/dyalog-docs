**Applies To:** [Splitter](../objects/splitter.md)

**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported while a [Splitter](../objects/splitter.md) object is being dragged, between a [StartSplit](./startsplit.md) and an [EndSplit](./endsplit.md). This event is only reported if full-drag is enabled.


This event is reported for information alone. You may not disable or nullify the event by setting the action code for the event to `¯1` or by returning 0 from a callback function.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 6-element vector as follows :


|-----|------|-----------------------------|
|`[1]`|Object|ref or character vector      |
|`[2]`|Event |`'Splitting'` or 281         |
|`[3]`|Y     |y-position of top left corner|
|`[4]`|X     |x-position of top left corner|
|`[5]`|H     |height of the Splitter       |
|`[6]`|W     |width of the Splitter        |
