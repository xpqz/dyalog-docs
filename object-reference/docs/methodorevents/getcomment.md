**Description**


This method is used to retrieve the comment associated with a cell in a [Grid](../objects/grid.md).


The argument to GetComment is a 2-element array as follows:


|-----|------|-------|
|`[1]`|Row   |integer|
|`[2]`|Column|integer|


For example, the following expression retrieves the comment associated with the cell at row 3, column 1.
```apl

If there is no comment associated with the specified cell, the result is a scalar 1.
