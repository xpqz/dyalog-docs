**Applies To:** [ActiveXControl](../objects/activexcontrol.md), [OLEServer](../objects/oleserver.md)

**Description**


This method is used to describe an APL variable that is to be exported as a property of an [ActiveXControl](../objects/activexcontrol.md) or [OLEServer](../objects/oleserver.md) object.


The argument to SetVarInfo is a 2 or 3-element array as follows:


*Variable info* is either a simple character vector that specifies the
[COM data type](../miscellaneous/com-data-types.md) of the variable, or a 2-element vector of character vectors whose first element specifies a help string and whose second element specifies the [COM data type](../miscellaneous/com-data-types.md).


*Help ID* is an optional integer value that identifies the help context id within the help file associated with the HelpFile property of the ActiveXControl object. The value `¯1` means that no help is provided. APL stores this information in the registry from where it may be retrieved by the host application.
