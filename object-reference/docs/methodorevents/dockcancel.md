**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported by a client object when the user aborts a docking operation by pressing Escape.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 2-element vector as follows :


|-----|------|-----------------------|
|`[1]`|Object|ref or character vector|
|`[2]`|Event |`'DockCancel'` or 485  |


This event is reported for information only and cannot be cancelled or inhibited in any way.


The associated callback is run **immediately** while the windows notification is still on the stack. See [High-Priority Callback Functions](../../../interface-guide/introduction/high-priority-callbacks).
