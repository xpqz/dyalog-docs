<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">CellChanged</span> <span class="right">Event 164</span></h1>



**Applies To:** [Grid](../objects/grid.md)

**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported after the user has changed the contents of a cell in a [Grid](../objects/grid.md) object and then moved to another cell or to another control outside the [Grid](../objects/grid.md). The purpose of this event is to give the application the opportunity to perform calculations, and perhaps to update other cells in the [Grid](../objects/grid.md) as a result of the change.


Note that this event is reported **after** the change has taken place, and after the [Values](../properties/values.md) property has been updated. Furthermore, neither setting the event action code to `¯1` nor returning 0 from a callback function has any effect. If you wish to *validate* the new data you should use the [CellChange](./cellchange.md) (150) event instead.


The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/dq), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is an 5-element vector as follows:


|-----|-----------|-------------------------|
|`[1]`|Object     |ref or character vector  |
|`[2]`|Event      |`'CellChanged'` or 164   |
|`[3]`|Cell row   |integer                  |
|`[4]`|Cell column|integer                  |
|`[5]`|New data   |number or character array|


The 5th element of the event message contains the data value that has been used to update the [Values](../properties/values.md) property. This will be numeric if the [FieldType](../properties/fieldtype.md) of the associated Edit object is Numeric, LongNumeric, Date, LongDate or Time. Otherwise, it will be a character array.


If you want to update an individual cell under program control, you may call [CellChange](./cellchange.md), but not CellChanged, as a method.
