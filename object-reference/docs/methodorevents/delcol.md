**Applies To:** [Grid](../objects/grid.md)

**Description**


This method is used to delete a specified column from a [Grid](../objects/grid.md) object.


The argument to DelCol is a 1 or 2-element vector as follows:


|-----|-------------|----------------------------------------|
|`[1]`|Column number|number of the column (integer) to delete|
|`[2]`|Undo flag    |0 or 1 (optional; default 0)            |


If the *Undo flag* 1, the column may subsequently be restored by invoking the [Undo](./undo.md) method. If the *Undo flag* is omitted or is 0, the operation may not be undone.
