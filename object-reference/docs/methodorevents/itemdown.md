**Applies To:** [ListView](../objects/listview.md), [TreeView](../objects/treeview.md)

**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when the user depresses a mouse button when the mouse pointer is over an item in a [ListView](../objects/listview.md) or [TreeView](../objects/treeview.md) object. This event is reported for information only and may not be controlled in any way using a callback function. Generating the event with `⎕NQ`, or calling it as a method, has no effect.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 6-element vector as follows :


|---|---|---|
|`[1]`|Object|ref or character vector|
|`[2]`|Event|`'ItemDown'` or 340|
|`[3]`|Item number|Integer. The index of the item.|
|`[4]`|Mouse button|Integer.|
|`[5]`|Shift state|Integer. Sum of 1=shift key, 2=Ctrl key, 4=Alt key|
|`[6]`|Position|Integer. Indicates the position of the mouse-pointer within the item. It is either 2 (over the icon), 4 (over the label), 8 (over the line), 16 (over the symbol) or 32 (to the right of the label).|
