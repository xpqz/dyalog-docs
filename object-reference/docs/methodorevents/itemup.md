**Applies To:** [ListView](../objects/listview.md), [TreeView](../objects/treeview.md)

**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when the user releases a mouse button when the mouse pointer is over an item in a [ListView](../objects/listview.md) or [TreeView](../objects/treeview.md) object. This event is reported for information only and may not be controlled in any way using a callback function. Generating the event with `⎕NQ`, or calling it as a method, has no effect.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 6-element vector as follows :
