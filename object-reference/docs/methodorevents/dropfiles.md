If enabled, this event is reported when the user drags a file icon or a set of file icons and drops them onto the object. The system takes no action other than to report the event.


Note that the event is only reported if [AcceptFiles](../properties/acceptfiles.md) is set to 1.

|`[3]`|Files|Vector of character vectors containing the file names.|

|`[5]`|Shift state|Integer. Sum of 1=shift key, 2=Ctrl key, 4=Alt key|
