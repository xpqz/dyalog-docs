**Applies To:** [MDIClient](../objects/mdiclient.md)

**Description**


This method causes the [MDIClient](../objects/mdiclient.md) object to organise its child [Form](../objects/form.md)s in an overlapping fashion. To permit the user to carry out this action, it is recommended that a suitable callback function or expression is attached to a [MenuItem](../objects/menuitem.md) or [Button](../objects/button.md). The callback function or expression should then call MDICascade.


The MDICascade method is niladic.
