**Applies To:** [Calendar](../objects/calendar.md), [DateTimePicker](../objects/datetimepicker.md), [Root](../objects/root.md)

**Description**


This method is used to convert a date from an [IDN](../miscellaneous/international-day-number.md) into `⎕TS` format (year, month, day). The corresponding day of the week is also obtained.


The argument to IDNToDate is a single item as follows:


|-----|---|-------|
|`[1]`|IDN|Integer|


The result is a 4-element integer vector containing the year, month, day, and weekday corresponding to the IDN that was specified.


The value of the 4<sup>th</sup> element, weekday, is an integer in the range 0-6 that specifies on which day of the week the specified date falls (0=Monday).
