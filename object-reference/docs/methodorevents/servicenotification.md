**Applies To:** [Root](../objects/root.md)

**Description**


This event is generated in an APL service whenever the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM) requests a change of state. See [APL Application as a Service](../../../windows-installation-and-configuration-guide/apl-application-as-a-service).


The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/dq), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 4-element vector as follows :


|-----|------|-----------------------------|
|`[1]`|Object|ref or character vector      |
|`[2]`|Event |`'ServiceNotification'` or 94|
|`[3]`|Action|Integer.                     |
|`[4]`|State |7-element integer vector     |


For further details, see the on-line documentation for `SERVICE_STATE` and the function `HashDefine` in the sample workspace `aplservice`.


The state of a Windows service is determined by the user and the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM).


When the SCM requests a change of state, the APL interpreter responds by setting its state to the corresponding *pending* level (SERVICE_STOPPED_PENDING, SERVICE_RUNNING_PENDING or SERVICE_PAUSED_PENDING) and then generates a [ServiceNotification](./servicenotification.md) event.


It is the responsibility of the APL service to process this event, perform the appropriate application tasks, and then respond (to the SCM) by calling the [SetServiceState](./setservicestate.md) method to confirm that the service has reached the desired state.
