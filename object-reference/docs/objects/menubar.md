**Purpose:** Specifies a horizontal menu bar displayed at the top of a [Form](form.md) .

**Description**


Unless it is made invisible the MenuBar is always available to the user to initiate actions or to select options. A MenuBar has a fixed position and size.



It is possible to have more than one MenuBar associated with the same [Form](form.md) or [SubForm](subform.md), but only one of them should be [Visible](../properties/visible.md) at any one time.


The following example illustrates how a menu structure can be built up from a MenuBar. For clarity, the example is indented, and the definition of the [Event](../properties/event.md) property is omitted.
```apl
      'F'           ⎕WC 'Form' 'Menu Example'
      'F.M'         ⎕WC 'MenuBar'
      'F.M.FILE'    ⎕WC 'Menu' '&File'
      'F.M.MAT'     ⎕WC 'Menu' '&Materials'
      'F.M.MAT.B'   ⎕WC 'MenuItem' '&Brick'
      'F.M.MAT.C'   ⎕WC 'MenuItem' '&Concrete'
      'F.M.MAT.S'   ⎕WC 'MenuItem' '&Stone'
      'F.M.MAT.SEP' ⎕WC 'Separator'
      'F.M.MAT.W'   ⎕WC 'Menu'     '&Wood'
      'F.M.MAT.W.O' ⎕WC 'MenuItem' '&Oak'
      'F.M.MAT.W.T' ⎕WC 'MenuItem' '&Teak'
      'F.M.MAT.W.M' ⎕WC 'MenuItem' '&Mahogany'
```


Note that putting a [Separator](separator.md) (either [Style](../properties/style.md)) in a MenuBar has the effect of breaking the bar vertically, that is, the next [Menu](menu.md) or [MenuItem](menuitem.md) you add will appear on the left-hand side on the line below.


The [EdgeStyle](../properties/edgestyle.md) property has no effect on the appearance of a MenuBar or of a direct child of a MenuBar. However, if you want the sub-menus to have a 3-dimensional appearance, you **must** set the [EdgeStyle](../properties/edgestyle.md) property of the MenuBar to something other than `'None'`.


If the MenuBar is owned by a [Form](form.md) that is the parent of an [MDIClient](mdiclient.md), you can set the [MDIMenu](../properties/mdimenu.md) property to the name of the [Menu](menu.md) you wish to nominate as the *window*  menu. This menu will automatically be updated with the [Caption](../properties/caption.md)s of the child [SubForm](subform.md) and may be used to select the currently active one.
