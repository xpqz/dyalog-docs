**Purpose:** The TabControl object provides access to the native Windows tab         control.

**Description**


The standard tab control is analogous to a set of dividers in a notebook and
allows you to define a set of *pages* that occupy the same area of a window
or dialog box. Each page consists of a set of information or a group of controls
that the application displays when the user selects the corresponding tab.



A special type of tab control displays tabs that look like buttons. For
example, the Windows taskbar is such a tab control.


The overall appearance of the TabControl is determined by the [Style](../properties/style.md) property which may be `'Tabs'` (the
default), `'Buttons'` or `'FlatButtons'`.


Individual tabs or buttons are represented by [TabButton](tabbutton.md) objects which should be created as children of the TabControl object. Optional
captions and pictures are specified by the [Caption](../properties/caption.md) and [ImageIndex](../properties/imageindex.md) properties of the
individual [TabButton](tabbutton.md) objects themselves.
Otherwise, the appearance of the tabs or buttons is determined by properties of
the TabControl itself.


To implement a multiple page tabbed dialog [(see Example 1)](../examples/tabcontrol-example-1.md), you should create a [Form](form.md), then a
TabControl with Style `'Tabs'` as a child of
the [Form](form.md). Next, create one or more pairs of [TabButton](tabbutton.md) and [SubForm](subform.md) objects as children of the
TabControl. You associate each [SubForm](subform.md) with a
particular tab by setting its [TabObj](../properties/tabobj.md) property to the name of, or ref to, the associated [TabButton](tabbutton.md) object. Making the [SubForms](subform.md) children of the
TabControl ensures that, by default, they will automatically be resized
correctly. You may alternatively create your [SubForms](subform.md) as children of the main [Form](form.md) and establish
appropriate resize behaviour using their [Attach](../properties/attach.md) property.


A TabControl object with [Style](../properties/style.md) `'Buttons'` [(Example 2)](../examples/tabcontrol-example-2.md) or `'FlatButtons'`[ (Example 3)](../examples/tabcontrol-example-3.md) may be used in a similar
way (that is, to display a set of alternative pages), although buttons in this type
of TabControl are more normally used to execute commands. For this reason, these
styles of TabControl are without borders.


If [Style](../properties/style.md) is `'FlatButtons'`,
the [FlatSeparators](../properties/flatseparators.md) property
specifies whether or not separators are drawn between the buttons. The default
value of [FlatSeparators](../properties/flatseparators.md) is 0 (no
separators).


[Example 3a](../examples/tabcontrol-example-3a.md) shows the
effect of setting [FlatSeparators](../properties/flatseparators.md) to
1.


The [Align](../properties/align.md) property specifies along which
of the 4 edges of the TabControl the tabs or buttons are arranged. [Align](../properties/align.md) also controls the relative positioning of the picture and Caption within each
TabButton. [Align](../properties/align.md) may be Top (the default),
Bottom, Left or Right.


If [Align](../properties/align.md) is `'Top'` or `'Bottom'`[ (Example
4)](../examples/tabcontrol-example-4.md), the tabs or buttons are arranged along the top or bottom edge of the
TabControl and picture is drawn to the left of the Caption.


If [Align](../properties/align.md) is `'Left'` [(Example 5)](../examples/tabcontrol-example-5.md), the tabs or buttons are
arranged top-to-bottom along the left edge of the TabControl, and the pictures
are drawn below the Captions.


[In recent versions of Windows, ](../properties/align.md)`'Align' 'Right'` fails to show the tabs or buttons on the right hand edge of the TabControl; this appears to be a limitation of Windows.


The [Attach](../properties/attach.md) property specifies how the
TabControl responds when its parent is resized. Its default value, which is
independent of the [Align](../properties/align.md) property, is `'None'
'None' 'None' 'None'`. This causes the TabControl to maintain its
original proportions when its parent is resized.


The [MultiLine](../properties/multiline.md) property determines
whether or not your tabs or buttons will be arranged in multiple flights or
multiple rows/columns.


The default value of [MultiLine](../properties/multiline.md) is 0,
in which case, if you have more tabs or buttons than will fit in the space
provided, the TabControl displays an UpDown control to permit the user to scroll
them. [See Example 7.](../examples/tabcontrol-example-7.md)


If [MultiLine](../properties/multiline.md) is set to 1, the tabs are
displayed in multiple flights [(Example 8)](../examples/tabcontrol-example-8.md) or the buttons are displayed in multiple rows [(Example
9)](../examples/tabcontrol-example-9.md).


The [ScrollOpposite](../properties/scrollopposite.md) property
specifies that unneeded tabs scroll to the opposite side of a TabControl, when a
tab is selected. Setting [ScrollOpposite](../properties/scrollopposite.md) to 1 forces [MultiLine](../properties/multiline.md) to 1 also.


[Example 10](../examples/tabcontrol-example-10.md) illustrates a
TabControl with [ScrollOpposite](../properties/scrollopposite.md) set
to 1, after the user has clicked *Third Tab*. Notice that, in this example,
the SubForms have been created as children of the TabControl. This is necessary
to ensure that they are managed correctly in this case.


If [MultiLine](../properties/multiline.md) is 1, the way that
multiple flights of tabs or rows/columns of buttons are displayed is further
defined by the Justify property which may be `'Right'` (the default) or `'None'`.


If [Justify](../properties/justify.md) is `'Right'`(which is the default), the TabControl increases the width of each tab, if
necessary, so that each row of tabs fills the entire width of the tab control.
Otherwise, if [Justify](../properties/justify.md) is empty or `'None'`,
the rows are ragged.


See [Example 11](../examples/tabcontrol-example-11.md) (for tabs) and [Example 12](../examples/tabcontrol-example-12.md) (for
buttons).


By default, the size of the tabs may vary from one to another. Fixed size
tabs may be obtained by setting the [TabSize](../properties/tabsize.md) property.


To obtain fixed sized tabs with [MultiLine](../properties/multiline.md) set to 1, you must however also set Justify to `'None'`.


If fixed size tabs are in effect, the positions at which the picture and
Caption are drawn within each [TabButton](tabbutton.md) is
controlled by the [TabJustify](../properties/tabjustify.md) property
which may be `'Centre'`, `'Edge'`,
or `'IconEdge'`.


[Example
13](../examples/tabcontrol-example-13.md) illustrates these different settings.


The font used to draw the captions in the [TabButton](tabbutton.md) objects is determined by the [FontObj](../properties/fontobj.md) property of the TabControl.


You cannot specify the foreground or background colours of the tabs/buttons,
nor can you use different fonts in different tabs/buttons. The orientation of
the Caption text is always determined by the value of the Align property of the
TabControl.


The [TabObj](../properties/tabobj.md) property is read-only and
reports the name of, or ref to, the [TabButton](tabbutton.md) that is currently selected.


The [MultiSelect](../properties/multiselect.md) property specifies
whether or not the user can select more than one button in a TabControl at the
same time, by holding down the Ctrl key when clicking. The default is 0 (only
one button may be selected). [MultiSelect](../properties/multiselect.md) is ignored if Style is `'Tabs'`.


The [TabFocus](../properties/tabfocus.md) property specifies the
focus behaviour for the TabControl object and may be `'Normal'` (the
default), `'Never'` or `'ButtonDown'`.


The [HotTrack](../properties/hottrack.md) property specifies whether
or not the tabs or buttons are automatically highlighted by the mouse pointer.
The default is 0 (no highlighting).
